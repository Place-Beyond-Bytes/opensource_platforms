I_kwDOEA7yes5ej7ix,cannot find run_spp.R,CLOSED,2023-02-15T20:03:50Z,2023-02-15T20:17:28Z,2023-02-15T20:17:28Z,"Hi there,

I have tried to run the pipeline with test dataset, but there is an error which is from  RUN_SPP=`which run_spp.R`. I also tried to find this R file with 'find ./ -name ""run_spp.R""' command but still cannot find it. I am not sure if this run_spp.R file is not generated in processing or is forgot to put under the corresponding directory. 

Any help will be appreciated.

Just wondering if this repo is actively monitored? Where can I obtain a copy of the singularity images used in this repo?

Thanks very much!
