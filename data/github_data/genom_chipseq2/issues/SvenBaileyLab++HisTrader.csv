I have used it to detect NFRs from H3K27Ac ChIP-seq. The results looks good, but I just want to make sure that I have used the program correctly. 

I actually did not use ""--broad"" option in MACS3, which means peaks I called are not broad (i.e. not the *.broadPeak file). However, I still have NFRs in the H3K27Ac peaks I detected. So it is actually OK to use *.narrowPeak results when detecting NFRs from H3K27Ac peaks?

Another question is that if I have multiple NFR results from different biological replicates, is there a quick way to get consensus NFRs?

Thank you for your time, regards!",zhiyi1988,https://github.com/SvenBaileyLab/HisTrader/issues/1
I_kwDODV9qOM6E7Jp6,Program is stuck,CLOSED,2024-04-08T01:52:30Z,2024-04-30T15:54:11Z,2024-04-30T15:54:11Z,"Hi, I have processed the files generated from three biological replicates. They all had the same format, and two of them worked fine. One was stuck and constantly showed ""Use of uninitialized value $d_offset in seek at XXX/Histrader.pl line 411."" It can generate output, but just cannot finish its work.

Normally, the end of the output file looks like this:

While the stuck one shows this:

May I ask how to solve the problem?

Thanks, regards.

Could you clarify what kind of BEDGRAPH files this tool expects?

I tried generating some using bedtools genomecov but have been getting errors where the index is out of range.

Now I'm considering MACS2 but this also outputs several types of bedgraphs...

Many thanks!",CriticalSci,https://github.com/SvenBaileyLab/HisTrader/issues/3
