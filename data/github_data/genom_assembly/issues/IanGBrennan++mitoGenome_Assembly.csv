I_kwDOB8l18s6OjORl,mira error: C++,OPEN,2024-07-05T01:02:56Z,2024-07-05T01:02:56Z,,"Hey Ian, 

I found an error and a workaround. 

On some machines the pre-compiled library of mira throws an error in the log file:

```
==============
 ITERATION 1
==============
Jul  5 09:38:54


quick option baits reads from provided reference in iteration 0

fishing readpool using mirabait (k = 31)

mirabait: loadlocale.c:130: _nl_intern_locale_data: Assertion `cnt < (sizeof (_nl_value_type_LC_TIME) / sizeof (_nl_value_type_LC_TIME[0]))' failed.

your readpool does not contain any reads with reasonable match (k = 31) to your reference - Maybe you ll want to try different settings or even a different reference?

```

I investigated further and it seems like this is a known bug reported on the mira sourceforge page [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/mira-assembler/tickets/40/). [Bastien Chevreux](https://sourceforge.net/u/bach/profile/) the author of MIRA wrote 

```
A bug of the C++ libraries which I learned to circumvent in later versions of MIRA. Should you insist on using 4.0.2, the workaround is:
export LC_ALL=C
in the shell, then it will work.
```

For the time being, I recommend modifying `mtGenome_Assembly_Nick.R`:

```
final.call <- paste(change.to.directory, "";"", ""export LC_ALL=C"", "";"", mitobim.call)
      system(final.call)
```",stiatragul,https://github.com/IanGBrennan/mitoGenome_Assembly/issues/1
