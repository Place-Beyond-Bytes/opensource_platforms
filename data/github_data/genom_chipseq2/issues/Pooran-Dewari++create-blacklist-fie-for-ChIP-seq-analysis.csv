I_kwDOIicmmM6bHN2p,Some confusion about blacklist identification.,OPEN,2024-10-21T12:11:42Z,2024-11-04T11:56:16Z,,"Hi, @Pooran-Dewari 

Thank you for these additions to the `Blacklist` software for identifying problematic regions of the genome. There are a few more details about identifying Blacklist areas that I'd like your advice on.

The number of Input data is critical if one wants to identify Blacklist regions from scratch, so the collected data often contain different reads lengths and different sequencing models ( Single-end 36bp, Single-end 50bp, Single-end 100bp, Paired-end 100bp , Paired-end 150bp), how should the kmer be chosen at this time, and the limits on the uniqLength. I'm actually trying to integrate data from different lengths of single-ended as well as double-ended to characterize the Blacklist region.

According to your advice, I have changed `blacklist.cpp` from `int uniqueLength = 36` to `int uniqueLength = 100`. For combined unit8.unique(k75, k100, k150), how should I choose an appropriate uniqLength before compiling, even though the author says that the value of uniqLength needs to correspond to the value of kmer in the generated unit8.unique file?

Looking forward to your reply.
Best regards.
Yao
