MDU6SXNzdWUxMDQ4MTA1MjA=,can't load HTSLib Shared library despite it being on the $PATH; no config file to modify,CLOSED,2015-09-04T01:10:21Z,2015-09-04T16:21:38Z,2015-09-04T16:08:59Z,"Hi,

I'm excited to use your tool on some of my data. However, I have an error that I can't figure out how to solve.

Here is the output I see:

```
$ ./giremi
giremi: error while loading shared libraries: libhts.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

However, my $PATH variable includes the location of this file:

```
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/lib
$ ls /usr/local/lib/libhts.so.1
/usr/local/lib/libhtso.so.1
```

Your README.md says `Please make sure your dynamic library path in your configuration file includes the directory in which HTSlib is installed`, but I don't see what configuration file I'm supposed to be modifying, and I don't know how to recompile the giremi script from source.

Let me know how I can solve this issue.

Thanks,
Warren

I'm Dr. Taylor's student at CHOP. We had been communicating via email, but your ucla address seems to be down. 

I've run giremi on several samples, and I'm running into a problem. The program stops short of generating the 'ifRNAE' column. This is likely related to the fact that in the output file, there are only N's in the columns refB, upB, downB and majorB, even though the corresponding positions are not N's. Do you know what might be causing this issue?

In my output everything seems fine as far as I can tell but there is no ""IfRNAE"" column and no ""RNAE_t"" column. I'm a bit new to the subject so please excuse if I'm making some huge mistake.

I'm running Giremi with a fasta ref file from GRC the first line looks like this: 

> 1 dna:chromosome chromosome:GRCh37:1:1:249250621:1

[head_of_RNA-seq.txt](https://github.com/zhqingit/giremi/files/144119/head_of_RNA-seq.txt)

The SNV file I'm using I created from what I believe to be a standard SNP data set, that file is called dbsnp_142.GRCh38.vcf, but in this file there were no gene names mentioned but everything else required of this input file seemed to be present. As I'm new to this subject the fact that this data is missing in this file makes me wonder if I'm not making some huge misinterpretation of how to use this file. 

The output I get from Giremi is:

I am trying to detect RNA editing differences between RNASeq normal and tumor samples from the same individual, but I am a bit confused about the list(s) of SNV to use.

I am using the following strategy but not sure if it is correct:
(1) detect germline mutations from normal (with GATK HaplotypeCaller)
(2) detect germline and somatic mutations from tumor (with GATK Mutect2)
(3) Discard homozygous variants
(4) Annotate the variants and tag the ones present in dbSNP and COSMIC databases
(5) Call RNA editing sites in normal and tumor separately with their respective lists
(6) Check which sites are present in tumor but not in normal.

Questions:
* Variants present in dbSNP and COSMIC (tagged as ""1"") will be filtered out by GIREMI, right?
* For the tumor sample, should I use instead the germline SNV list obtained from the normal sample (since it is the same individual) and just add the somatic variants detected?
* Or, for the tumor sample, call the germline variants in the tumor sample with the same program as the normal sample and then call the somatic variants with Mutect and add them together to the tumor SNV list?
* Should I include germline and somatic variants called from the DNA of these sample as well?

I'm using GIREMI to find some RNAE in my RNA-seq data. I have good aligned file src.bam, reads are paired end (and properly paired). I'm performing following steps:

1. Sorting bam in coordinate order and indexing it via samtools sort and index. Output file: sorted.bam
2. Variant calling: samtools mpileup -ugf genome.fa sorted.bam -q 1 | bcftools view -bvcg - > raw.bcf
3. Filtering results: 
bcftools view  raw.bcf | vcfutils.pl varFilter -D100 | awk '$6>=10' | grep ""0\/1:"" > filtered.vcf
In this line I remove homozygous SNV's by grep ""0\/1:""
4. Annotating filtered.vcf and generating SNV list file (if dbSNP, gene name, strand etc) via snpEff and own simple python script
5. Running GIREMI: ./giremi -f genome.fa -l SNV_list.txt -o result sorted.bam

Maybe I'm doing something wrong or missing some important steps? Looking forward for your answer and thank you very much!

Since JohnMCMa had mentioned in #25 that GATK would achieve local realignment around indels before using HaplotypeCaller to call variants, I've tried to use bam files produced by GATK as bam inputs in GIREMI, while the error remained.

Could anyone give some solutions about it? Thanks very much!",yang91,https://github.com/zhqingit/giremi/issues/40
MDU6SXNzdWUyNjUxNDkwNjM=,major_base all N and pvalue_MI all -1,OPEN,2017-10-13T02:20:01Z,2017-10-13T02:20:01Z,,"
Hi, Qing,

I met some problems when running the Rscript of Giremi (for Drosophila melanogaster RNA-seq data):
(1) The major_base column is all N;
(2) The pvalue_MI column is all -1, or sometimes with a few zero.
(3) The ifRNAE column is all 0.

These cause the abortion in the ""ids = which(dat[,""major_base""]==""N"")  if (length(ids)>0) dat = dat[-ids,]"" step and ""pvalue_MI>0 & pvalue_MI <= 0.01"" step.
Thus the dat.pos, dat.neg and dat.unknown files are all empty.

I have read the instructions and comments in these pages, and it doesn't seem to be the problem of the ""list file"", 
2L	5091	5092	Inte	1	+
2L	5094	5095	Inte	1	+
2L	5371	5372	Inte	1	+
2L	5389	5390	Inte	1	+
2L	5402	5403	Inte	1	+

The SNP sites were called from GATK with strict criteria, and I have tried to set the $5 to be 0 or 1, and got the same problems.
I have also tried both single-end and pair-end libraries, and the same problems occurred.

I wonder what I should do to make the script run? I just want to get the list of editing sites in each library.

Thanks !
