The run_protocol_0.53.sh script tries to download the NA12881 (ERR324432_X.fastq.gz) files, but they are no longer available at the specified address, and I cannot find them anywhere else online. Please could you let me know where I can find them, or update the script to use a different dataset?

Thanks.",LukeGoodsell,https://github.com/hanfang/scalpel-protocol/issues/1
