I made config.sim file with del, ins, dup, inv except translocation.
SVsim supports translocation event?
then, how to make config file for translocation?
is there any example config file?

MDU6SXNzdWU1MDIyNjA4NTI=,Unable to get DUPL command to work correctly,OPEN,2019-10-03T19:44:51Z,2019-10-03T19:44:51Z,,"Hello,

I am unable to get the DUPL command to work correctly when attempting to use it to make a repeating duplication on hg19.
I am interested repeating a certain 3-base portion of the hg19 WGS 16 times (just as an example), inserting these repetitions immediately after the selected portion. 

An example of the command.sim that I am using is:
DUPL chrX 66765222 66765225

Executed with the command:
SVsim -i command.sim -W -n 16 -d -r hg19.fasta -o example_output.fasta

What I am getting as an output is that single base at 66765225 is being being duplicated and inserted to the right a single time. I've been able to insert sequences successfully with the INSL command but can't seem to figure out DUPL - is there some way I am approaching this wrong?

Thank you in advance.",hauduc,https://github.com/GregoryFaust/SVsim/issues/4

Thank you for developing this useful tool! I've noticed that after running svsim in whole genome mode with two INCL and DELL commands, the SV's are successfully added to the fasta file output, but there are no event record in the `.events` file. Further, there are three Is this expected behavior? I just wanted to report this in case it's unexpected and is worthy of a bug fix. ",gtollefson,https://github.com/GregoryFaust/SVsim/issues/5

I have commands.sim file as follows

  len = len + increment
