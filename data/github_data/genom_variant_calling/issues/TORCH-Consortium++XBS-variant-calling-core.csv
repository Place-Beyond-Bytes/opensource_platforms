I would like to test your code but I encountered some issues regarding the vcf format in which the sets of trusted SNPs and indels should be provided.

Could you please add to this repository some examples of SNP_TRUTH and INDEL_TRUTH files so that anyone could build a vcf file using its own trusted set?

best regards,
