MDU6SXNzdWUxOTE4NDcwMTY=,How to draw figure of normal fan,CLOSED,2016-11-27T07:25:01Z,2019-02-02T02:40:48Z,2019-02-02T02:40:48Z,"As README.md says, ""The result will be saved in test_seq/tRNA/c.diphtheriae_tRNA.rnapoly, which can be read directly or used with rna_poly.py to produce a Sage polytope for further investigation."", I could get .rnapoly file by executing `pmfe-parametlizer`, however, I don't see how to use this file with rna_poly.py module to draw figures shown in your paper. 
Could you tell me how to use these in more detail?",watabiro,https://github.com/AMS-MRC-disc-math-bio/pmfe/issues/1
