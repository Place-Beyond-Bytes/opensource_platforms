I_kwDOEhW7sc5PDJri,Command line version?,CLOSED,2022-08-02T18:14:20Z,2022-09-04T13:08:51Z,2022-09-04T13:08:51Z,"Hello, 

Thank you for developing BRIO - the BRIO website is really useful and intuitive. 

However, I was wondering if there's a command line or an option to run more than 100 sequences at a time (my dataset has over 2000 sequences...)?

I was also wondering what was the rationale for input RNA molecules to be less than 3000 nucleotides long, given that some mRNA sequences can be >10kb long?

Thank you,
Szi Kay",SziKayLeung,https://github.com/bioinformatics-torvergata/BRIO/issues/14
