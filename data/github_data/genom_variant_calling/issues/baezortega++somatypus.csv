I encountered an issue using Somatypus in the genotyping stage.

(8) PREPARING DATA FOR VARIANT GENOTYPING
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""/hgsccl/next-gen/scratch/chander/software/somatypus/src/Somatypus_ExtractRegions.py"", line 138, in <module>
   
start = int(exonComp[1].split('-')[0])
IndexError: list index out of range

ERROR: Output file /hgsccl/next-gen/scratch/chander/somatypus_out/8-18_genotyped/was not correctly generated. Please check the logs folder for more information.

Any thoughts why this error occurs?

Best,

MDU6SXNzdWU1Njk5NzI3NjM=,¡Stop this chromosome discrimination!,CLOSED,2020-02-24T16:31:11Z,2020-02-25T16:12:18Z,2020-02-25T16:12:18Z,"Yo man, your tool here is nice - but I can no longer accept the discriminatory nature of your code against organisms with large chromosomes!

I mean really large chromosomes, larger than yours. Think about [marsupials](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB35073), for example. Plants, big genome plants. Or what would the [Marbled lungfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbled_lungfish) say if you can't run somatypus on him? ""Speciesism!""

[CSI indexing on VCFs and BAM files is the future](https://github.com/samtools/htsjdk/issues/447), I tell ya bro. Check out my brand new golden changes to your core bash script, here attached. 

No questions. Peace out.
