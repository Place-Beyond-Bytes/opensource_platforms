I_kwDOC48Y785HYd5E,Low no. of reads when re-analyzing Grosselin et. al. 2019 data,CLOSED,2022-04-08T17:44:54Z,2022-04-12T13:25:58Z,2022-04-12T12:46:32Z,"Hello

I have processed the data from Grosselin et. al. 2019 from [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE117309) through this pipeline. But I seem to recover a much lower number of reads compared to what I'd expect from the paper. (total 887 barcodes detected with mean count of ~5 and max count of ~200). I mapped the data to both human and mouse genome separately using STAR index. 

What I see is that while there are enough uniquely mapping reads, the number of barcoded reads that I keep are extremly low, even though the number of detected barcodes from the bowtie mapping seems to be reasonable (I attached the numbers per sample). 

Could you help me figure out what the issue could be?
