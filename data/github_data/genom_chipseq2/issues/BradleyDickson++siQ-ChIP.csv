I_kwDOC2i9Qc5y8A9T,Adapting code for S. cerevisiae,CLOSED,2023-10-05T13:45:39Z,2024-05-20T19:57:05Z,2024-05-20T19:57:05Z,"Hi @BradleyDickson,

Thank you for your great work in [JBC](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32994221/) and [Sci Rep](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37160995/). I and @Rina-Hirano are eager to apply the siQ-ChIP method to ChIP-seq data generated in our lab, all of which come from *S. cerevisiae*.

I understand we'll need to [manually adjust some lines code](https://github.com/BradleyDickson/siQ-ChIP#the-siq-chip-codebase-warnings). 

> Some human-genome-specific things are hardcoded. We have set this up for mouse but the code here is for HUMAN. Reach out to me if you're using this outside human genome, it is easy to adapt to other cases.

Can you let us know where and how?

Thanks,
