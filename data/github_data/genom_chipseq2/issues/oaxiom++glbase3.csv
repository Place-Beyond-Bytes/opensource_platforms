I found glbase3 very useful when doing RNA-seq analysis last year. As I just wanted to use it, however, it seems the hg clone link doesn't exit, seen as below:
`$ hg clone --debug https://bitbucket.org/oaxiom/glbase2using https://bitbucket.org/oaxiom/glbase2
sending capabilities command
abort: HTTP Error 404: Not Found`

Could you provide any solution to this?

Your help will be appreciated.",leeyoyohku,https://github.com/oaxiom/glbase3/issues/2
