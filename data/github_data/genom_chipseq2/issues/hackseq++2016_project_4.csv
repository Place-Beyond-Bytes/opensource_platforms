MDU6SXNzdWUxNzY1NDE4Mjk=,Welcome!,OPEN,2016-09-13T03:48:16Z,2016-10-15T02:14:06Z,,"Ciao!  Thanks for joining this project!

I am Luca Pinello the team leader for @hackseq/2016_team_4 .

I am currently an Instructor at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Harvard School of Public Health and from 1st of October Assistant Professor at MGH/Harvard Medical School (pinellolab.org)

Just want to say that I am very excited to have all of you on-board. I have reviewed your application forms and I think this event will be a blast. 

I have just updated the readme with the motivations and goals of this project, and added a section called suggested reading (if you have any other paper you think we should read before the event please add it to the readme or to this thread)

It can be nice if you can briefly introduce yourself and write what are your expectations for this event.

Hope to hear from all of you soon!
