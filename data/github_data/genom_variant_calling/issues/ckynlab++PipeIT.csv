MDU6SXNzdWU1OTQyNDExNjA=,"Error message: ""An error occurred while working with the tmp directory /scratch""",OPEN,2020-04-05T04:01:12Z,2020-07-06T13:49:13Z,,"Hi, 

Thank you for writing PipeIT Container.  This is very helpful for Ion Torrent users.
I tried to use the PipeIT Singularity Container (20190409 version), but got an error message as below:

##### ERROR MESSAGE: An error occurred while working with the tmp directory /scratch. You can specify -Djava.io.tmpdir=X on the command line (before the -jar argument) where X is a directory path, to use a more appropriate temporary directory. Note that this is a JVM argument, not a GATK argument. The exact error was Unable to create directory

I've traced the source of this error message and found  this error message resulted from this commend:
java -Djava.io.tmpdir=/scratch -Xmx7G -jar /PipeIT_resources/usr/local/bin/GenomeAnalysisTK-3.6.jar  -S LENIENT -T LeftAlignAndTrimVariants -filterNoBases -R $REF -V PipeIT/sample/$OUT/TSVC_variants.multiallelic_ft.norm.vcf -o PipeIT/sample/$OUT/TSVC_variants.multiallelic_ft.norm.left_align.vcf && sleep 5

I suppose the reason for this error message is that the tmp folder ""/scratch"" does not exist inside the Container, and it is not allowed to create the tmp folder ""/scratch"" because the Container is read-only?

Therefore I modified the part ""-Djava.io.tmpdir=/scratch"" to ""-Djava.io.tmpdir=./scratch"" throughout the entire script, which changed the path of tmp folder to local machine, and then the script can run successfully without any errors.

If you could help resolve this issue, it would be very appreciated.

With warm regards, 
Yi-Chen

We would like to use PipeIT with the hg38 genome reference. Is that possible?

Thanks for your answer
