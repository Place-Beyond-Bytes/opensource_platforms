I_kwDOLHMh3M6f9T4p,Training Script of the RhoDesign,OPEN,2024-11-22T15:43:26Z,2024-11-22T15:43:26Z,,"Dear Team

Thank you for releasing the RhoDesign code and all the datasets used in development. I have been exploring the repository and it seems to be a promising tool for aptamer design. 

I noticed that the repository does not include a training script. As mentioned in your paper, when applied to the design of Mango aptamers, RhoDesign was retrained on the dataset with similar structures removed. Could you share the code related to the training process? A training script would be incredibly beneficial for replicating and extending your work.

Thank you once again for your valuable contributions to the field. I look forward to your response.

With regards,
