I am trying to run the PILEUP -> VCF_EXTRACT -> SPLIT workflow through gotcloud vc --conf my.config. On line 1155 from this commit (https://github.com/statgen/gotcloud/commit/f03fca07453a332a3c3ccd3061d9f4ef8edf7022#diff-e67da9ac72c8206f6cf7f682a0022e05) the code is: 

writeTouch(""$vcf"");

but $vcf does not exist. There is a $vcf.gz file that exists in that directory. When I manually gunzip the .vcf.gz file in that directory and re-run make it successfully runs through the workflow and creates the expected output. 

If I look at the old umake.pl code that is distributed as standalone code this is simply a touch not a writeTouch command. With the old umake.pl I had no issues running this workflow.

Best,

MDU6SXNzdWUxMjE4MTQ4MDk=,Avoid the large scheduler overhead for short jobs,OPEN,2015-12-11T23:46:21Z,2017-03-24T22:11:33Z,,"**To use job arrays:**

I see two methods:
1. All instances of `runcluster.pl` have a mutex.  When `runcluster.pl` runs, it:
   1. writes a jobfile the directory `in_queue`
   2. acquires the mutex, using `flock`.
   3. checks how many other jobfiles have been written to that directory
   4. if some threshold has been met (eg, the oldest jobfile is > 30 seconds old, or there are > 50 jobfiles), it gathers up all the jobfiles, submits them as a job array, and removes them from that directory.
   5. if its jobfile doesn't get run in a minute, it submits it as a normal job.
2. All instances of `runcluster.pl` simply write out a jobfile.  A daemon (just a separate job running parallel to `make`) watches the output directory and deals with submitting job arrays.

Options for `runcluster.pl` to know the jobid to watch:
- The submitter writes a file mapping from script filename to jobid.  `runcluster.pl` first waits for this file to be created, and then waits for its job.
- `runcluster.pl` sets the jobname in the script, and then queries by job name.
  - On flux, `#PBS -N foo` will name a job.  I can't find a way to query a job by its `PBS_JOBNAME`, but I can view the name with `Job_Name = (.*)` in `qstat -f <jobid>`, so at least it would provide a nice sanity check.
  - On Slurm, we have `squeue --name=job_name`.
- `runcluster.pl` chooses the array id and puts it into the job's script's filename
  - On both slurm and flux, the array indexes can be specified with commas (like `1,14,42,66` rather than a simple range `14-18`).  Jobs' scripts' filenames could be of the format `<random_job_array_id>--<much_longer_random_string>`.  After writing a scriptfile, `runcluster.pl` could check whether a collision had occurred.  Then `runcluster.pl` would know the `PBS_ARRAYID`/`SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` to query.
  - Flux appears to allow arbitrarily large array ids.  Slurm has a configuration variable `MaxArraySize`, which appears to actually limit the maximum array id.  `scontrol show config | grep MaxArraySize` is 20k on `nomosix`.  If something goes wrong, a worker job would just fail.
- Each worker writes its job id into `foo.jobid` right next to `foo.ok`

[System::Command](https://metacpan.org/pod/System::Command) will handle stderr and stdout.  Some examples of its use are [here](https://github.com/statgen/csg-mapper/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=system).

To use that, we need to:
1. Understand, fix, and clean our cpanfile mess.  Chris recommends moving to Carton, which builds on cpanm (and its cpanfile).  Then somehow link the two Makefiles.  Because of our reliance on `MAKECMDGOALS` in `src/Makefile`, submakes probably won't work.
2. Switch the `system` with `$qout` in `runcluster.pl`, which is one that would really benefit from capturing stdout and stderr.  Check what `qstat` and `squeue` output to stdout and stderr, and whether they're the same.  Otherwise, combine stderr and stdout.

I was not able to find the AMI for gotcloud in AWS so I have followed the installation process recommended. Once I downloaded the source file, I cd'd into src and typed make.
I get the following error

Chromosome.cpp: In constructor ‘Chromosome::Chromosome(const string&, unsigned int, bool)’:
Chromosome.cpp:42:15: error: ‘*this.Chromosome::gs’ is used uninitialized [-Werror=uninitialized]
   42 |     if (this->gs) delete gs;
