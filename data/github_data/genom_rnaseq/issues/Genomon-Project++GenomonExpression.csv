MDU6SXNzdWUxOTg1NjUzODE=,Are FPKMs calculated this way actually comparable?,OPEN,2017-01-03T20:49:24Z,2017-01-03T20:49:24Z,,"I have noticed that in this program, the FPKM for a gene is defined as the FPKM for the transcript where [read count]/[length] is the largest. My experience is that, as a result, the gene length used for the same symbol can be very different for different individuals, despite using the same exon.bed. Would this make the FPKMs calculated this way any less comparable?",JohnMCMa,https://github.com/Genomon-Project/GenomonExpression/issues/1
