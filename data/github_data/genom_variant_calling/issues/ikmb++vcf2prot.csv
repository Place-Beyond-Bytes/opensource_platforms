I_kwDOFoolGM5Pn4LJ,error in generating protein sequence,CLOSED,2022-08-11T11:54:11Z,2022-08-16T09:58:30Z,2022-08-16T09:53:46Z,"dear @HeshamElAbd,
thank you very much for developing this very promising tool.
I successfully ran it on my infrastructure, but faced some problem for one case. It seems to complain about difficult cases with small indels. Please find attached the files. Would you be able to run it and check whether there is room for improvement regarding such case?
The program returns me this error `Critical error was encountered: for transcript: Solyc02g062560 the following mutations were observed` with a list of positions and instructions.

Thanks a lot!

Best regards,

Thomas

I_kwDOFoolGM5P4Iub,Problem with protein/transcript identifiers,OPEN,2022-08-16T10:05:58Z,2022-08-16T10:37:50Z,,"Hi Hesham,

this is not a real problem but solving it would make life easier :-D
I successfully ran VCF2PROT v0.1.4 but I add to correct the transcript identifier in the VCF file as well as in the reference fasta file.

My bcftools-annotated VCF file has `Solyc02g062560.3|Solyc02g062560.3.1` identifiers in the BCSQ fields and my protein file header is `Solyc02g062560.3.1`.
It seems that the `.` in the sequence name is causing some problem and in this case, the output `.fasta` file was empty. After removing the end of the sequence name (moving to  `Solyc02g062560.3|Solyc02g062560` in the VCF and to  `Solyc02g062560` in the reference fasta), vcf2prot finally succeeded in writing the proper corrected sequences.

Hope it will help for the future!

Best regards,

Thomas

I just wanted to bring up the issue that some variants are overlooked into incorporation into the protein.  Specifically I have seen that start-lost mutations annotated by bcftools are ignored and the protein is produced with all other mutations as normal.
