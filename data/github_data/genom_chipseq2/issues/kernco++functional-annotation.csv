MDU6SXNzdWUzNzg4NjQwNjE=,Wrong python version in call_peaks rule,CLOSED,2018-11-08T18:37:07Z,2018-11-09T21:38:45Z,2018-11-09T21:38:45Z,"I got this warning message when running until call_peaks rule:
```
Conda environment defines Python version < 3.5. Using Python of the master process to execute script. Note that this cannot be avoided, because the script uses data structures from Snakemake which are Python >=3.5 only.
/home/pengsc/miniconda3/bin/python /finno/data/users/sichong/FAANG/Nuclei_ATAC/.snakemake/scripts/tmp9qued067.CallPeaks.py
```
The python it uses instead is version 3.6.6 and the script it's calling is CallPeaks.py

Then I got this error in macs2 run:
```
ImportError: /home/pengsc/.cache/Python-Eggs/MACS2-2.1.1.20160309-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg-tmp/MACS2/IO/Parser.so: undefined symbol: PyFPE_jbuf
```
Which seems to result from a python version not being 2.7?

I was able to run macs2 separately on tagAlign files generated by previous steps successfully so bypassing this step is no problem. But I'm wondering if this is related to how snakemake sets up conda environment or is it simply a problem of my env setup?

No -B option used in macs2 callpeak command, which resulted in no treat_pileup.bdg files. 

Then in rule fold_enrichment (line 199):

pipeline attempts to call macs2 bdgcmp which uses bedGraph files generated in peak calling. And since there are no such files, this results in an error that shuts down pipeline.

And since we don't run ""control"" for ATAC, the bdgcmp call seems incorrect. Am I missing something?",SichongP,https://github.com/kernco/functional-annotation/issues/3

So far, this URL (https://farm.cse.ucdavis.edu/~ckern/FAANG_Data/) points to the input data of Cattle only, the input data of pigs and chickens are all lost. 

Can you help restore access to the data? 

Thank you very much.
