I tried to use this workflow and ran into multiple issues, I guess it's related to the snakemake version:

If under 5.17.0

```
WorkflowError in line 37 of /project/umw_ingolf_bach/rui/final/chipseq/workflow/rules/peak_analysis.smk:
Extensions for multiext may not contain path delimiters (/,\) and must start with '.' (e.g. .txt).
  File ""/project/umw_ingolf_bach/rui/final/chipseq/workflow/Snakefile"", line 13, in <module>
  File ""/project/umw_ingolf_bach/rui/final/chipseq/workflow/rules/peak_analysis.smk"", line 37, in <module>
```

if version 6.4.1
```
MissingInputException in line 163 of /project/umw_ingolf_bach/rui/final/chipseq/workflow/rules/post-analysis.smk:
Missing input files for rule phantompeak_correlation:
../workflow/header/spp_corr_header.txt
```

Is this a snakemake version issue?  Snakemake seem to have trouble finding '../workflow' in the newer version, and it complained about syntax in the older version.

Which snakemake version was this tested on ? Thanks!
