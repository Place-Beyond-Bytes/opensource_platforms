Confirm the following by editing each check box to '[x]'

- [x ] I understand that by submitting my package to _Bioconductor_,
  the package source and all review commentary are visible to the
  general public.

- [x ] I have read the _Bioconductor_ [Package Submission][2]
  instructions. My package is consistent with the _Bioconductor_
  [Package Guidelines][1].

- [x ] My package addresses statistical or bioinformatic issues related
  to the analysis and comprehension of high throughput genomic data.

- [x ] I am committed to the long-term maintenance of my package. This
  includes monitoring the [support site][3] for issues that users may
  have, subscribing to the [bioc-devel][4] mailing list to stay aware
  of developments in the _Bioconductor_ community, responding promptly
  to requests for updates from the Core team in response to changes in
  _R_ or underlying software.

I am familiar with the essential aspects of _Bioconductor_ software
management, including:

- [x ] The 'devel' branch for new packages and features.
- [x ] The stable 'release' branch, made available every six
      months, for bug fixes.

  (optionally [via GitHub][6]).

For help with submitting your package, please subscribe and post questions
to the [bioc-devel][4] mailing list.

Indeed the grs is CompressedGRangesList. When I changed this via trace(""denoise_ERs"",edit=TRUE) it seemed to work normally.
