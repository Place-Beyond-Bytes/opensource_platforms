MDU6SXNzdWU3MDI1ODA4MjU=,MAnorm2_utils could not process the read file,OPEN,2020-09-16T08:51:00Z,2020-10-10T08:20:37Z,,"Hi.
I converted my bam files to sam. Then I used sam2bed.

I used the command profile bins for my peak files and read files; both were in bed format.

The tool could read the peak files but could not process the read files.

============

Produced by profile_bins, version=1.0.0

Equivalent parameter settings:
peaks=suz12_13CF.bed,suz12_14CF.bed
reads=suz12_13.markdup.bed,suz12_14.markdup.bed
labs=s13,s14
n=suz12
min-peak-gap=150
typical-bin-size=1500
summits=using_middle_points
paired=True
keep-dup=all
method=byBin
fix-bin-size=False

Summary of peak numbers in peak files:
peak_file	peaks_after_filtering	peaks_after_merging
suz12_13CF.bed	36694	36694
suz12_14CF.bed	38237	38237

Divide merged peaks into reference genomic bins:
77196 bins in total

Errors occur when parsing the read file,
suz12_14.markdup.bed:


Program aborted.

Please advice. Thank you.
