MDU6SXNzdWU0MTM1MTI1MjA=,callRegions output avg.posterior as array type,CLOSED,2019-02-22T17:54:21Z,2019-03-04T14:45:49Z,2019-03-04T14:45:49Z,"Hi,

`callRegions` calculates the average posterior by `tapply`, i.e. `reduced.posterior = apply(elementMetadata(called.granges)[,posterior.col], called2reduced[,2], mean, na.rm=T)`. Since the output of `tapply` is an `array` type by default, the `avg.posterior` field of `reduced.granges` is also of this type.

This turns out to cause breaking errors when using `makeGffAttributes` on `reduced.granges`, as `as.data.frame` in some versions of S4Vectors doesn't seem to properly parse a `DataFrame` with a field of `array` type. This in turns breaks `GR2gff`, and, thus, also breaks `histoneHMM_call_regions.R`.

On our side, one way to fix it is to coerce `reduced.posterior` (and, similarly, `reduced.expression`) to `numeric` before putting them in `mcols (reduced.granges)`.",JohnMCMa,https://github.com/matthiasheinig/histoneHMM/issues/5

Thank you for your work on histoneHMM! I have been using it to analyze some H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data. I just was wondering if you could clarify for me what the best way to include input controls per sample is, in your opinion? Would it be advisable to call differential peaks between IP & input first, and then use the significant peaks as input into other differential analyses? Or would you simply subtract any peaks that show up in the input as well? (Or something else I missed?)",kmattioli,https://github.com/matthiasheinig/histoneHMM/issues/9
