MDU6SXNzdWU5OTEzNTE3ODc=,Questions re: Centrifuge,OPEN,2021-09-08T17:07:31Z,2021-09-08T17:07:31Z,,"In Section 3.3.1, Centrifuge is used to filter long reads for contaminants that came from bacterial, archael, viral, or human DNA rather than the target species. 
Question 1: The tutorial says a python script is used to remove reads classified as contaminants, but it is not clear if that script uses any particular threshold level of contamination, or simply removes any read marked as classified. If it simply removes all classified reads, is the output from using the --un-gz option (save unclassified reads to gzip-compressed file) equivalent?
Question 2: Is there a risk of removing too much data? A single 50-nt match might occur by chance in a highly-conserved coding sequence (e.g. histones for eukaryotic species) to create false-positive hits that don't really reflect contamination.

I_kwDODoGz085AlgTJ,hybrid assembly of a viral genome,OPEN,2021-12-17T19:54:46Z,2021-12-17T19:54:46Z,,"Hi,
I am looking to make a hybrid assembly of a viral genome. I have got paired-end reads from Illumina and long reads from MinION from a viral sample. Please suggest a pipeline for making viral hybrid genome assembly. I am using Unicycler for bacteria and SPAdes for Illumina but these did not work for viral assembly. I came to know about MaSuRCA, CABOG and Wengan assember, but sure if they are appropriate for viral hybrid genome assembly.
Any suggestion will be appreciated.",sekhwal,https://github.com/CBC-UCONN/Genome_Assembly/issues/4
