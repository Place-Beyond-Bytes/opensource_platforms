I am now filtering a large bam file, I found that filterBam cost me a long time to run. Do you want to public the source code of filterBam-zlib-ng-2 ?

Best,

I'm especially interested in the one for MAKER since I'm currently annotating some genomes and hoping to use it.",shjenkins94,https://github.com/harvardinformatics/GenomeAnnotation/issues/5
I_kwDOECJc2M5ZyEBd,How to use this pipeline,CLOSED,2022-12-21T13:26:29Z,2024-04-10T14:03:35Z,2024-04-10T14:03:35Z,"Dear authors,

Thank you for your great contribution for this remarkable genome annotation pipeline!

Since there is no other genomeAnnotation pipeline people can follow, your great work means a lot for everyone like me who is new to this area. Although I read your wiki, I still don't know how to use or follow this pipeline. Should I install the related softwares one by one? Could you write a guideline or usage for this pipeline?

Merry Xmas!",lifan18,https://github.com/harvardinformatics/GenomeAnnotation/issues/6
I_kwDOECJc2M6g7H2k,Running workflow using RefSeq genomes instead of Ensembl,OPEN,2024-11-27T21:17:38Z,2024-11-27T21:17:38Z,,"Great for your workflow, really useful guide to perform Genome Annotation.
Unfortunately, I got stuck in the step `4c. Create CDS-only annotation bed file`, because I only obtain empty files. I think that I know the reason, so here is my hypothesis.

I'm using genomes from `RefSeq`, and so far in a lot of examples, if not all, I found that the genome annotation relies on genomes from `Ensembl`, which of course have another notation related to the IDs.

So, I started running the script `WriteChromLengthBedFromFasta.py`, using a `*_genomic.fna` file from the following [link](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/020/171/115/GCF_020171115.1_ASM_NN_V1/). For example, that file only contains a fasta file with the sequence of chromosome 1. After the conversion, my new `bed` file looks like this:
```
NC_000001.11	0	248956422
NT_187361.1	0	175055
NT_187362.1	0	32032
NT_187363.1	0	127682
NT_187364.1	0	66860
NT_187365.1	0	40176
NT_187366.1	0	42210
NT_187367.1	0	176043
NT_187368.1	0	40745
NT_187369.1	0	41717
```
The second column contains only **0**. This output made me understand that at some point I got an empty file because the information was incorrect, why I say that?, because other examples available contain **0 and other numbers**, so my question is:

- What do you think is happening? 
- Did anyone try to run this with RefSeq genomes too?
- Do I need to use another `.fna` file?

I really want to avoid changing to `Ensembl` genomes, because I had a lot of work already done with `RefSeq` data.
Any comment about what could be the source of the issue is more than welcome!",MauriAndresMU1313,https://github.com/harvardinformatics/GenomeAnnotation/issues/10
