MDU6SXNzdWU0NTM3MjMxNDY=,Where are the bam files?,CLOSED,2019-06-07T23:05:05Z,2019-06-14T00:06:09Z,2019-06-14T00:06:09Z,"Hello!

I am unable to locate the BAM files for the ChIP-Seq experiments. It says in the README:

""To run the analysis for the 4 datasets in the paper first download all the matrices and bam files in the repo root.""

These files do not seem to be included in the GEO entry or mentioned anywhere in the article. Where can the bam files be downloaded from? I am really hoping to avoid re-analyzing the fastq files if possible!

I saw that you may download the 10X bam files for the scRNA-Seq but I don't see any option to do so for the scChIP-Seq experiment. 

Thank you!",millerh1,https://github.com/vallotlab/scChIPseq/issues/1
MDU6SXNzdWU1NjA1MTMxNzY=,Issue with Gencode_TSS_pc_lincRNA_antisense.bed file,OPEN,2020-02-05T17:13:51Z,2020-06-02T09:50:02Z,,"Hi,

the file Gencode_TSS_pc_lincRNA_antisense.bed has an extra trailing tab at the end of every line which makes the R pipeline to fail when computing the annotation.

Also, it would be great if the authors could make the code to process the raw data available for the community (from SRA files to count matrices). It is unclear how to obtain the count matrices out of the SRA files posted at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA481734.
