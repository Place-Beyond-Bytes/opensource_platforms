MDU6SXNzdWU0NzI2MjA4Mzg=,Initialize with a sequence?,CLOSED,2019-07-25T01:26:18Z,2019-07-25T03:13:05Z,2019-07-25T03:13:05Z,"Hi, thank you for your fantastic visualization package! What's the best way to initialize the process w/ a seed sequence, such that you iteratively modify that initial sequence based on the target? I saw in the documentation that you can specify an init_sequence - would this be the best way? When I try to initialize with this parameter to a predetermined string, I get the following error:

MDU6SXNzdWU0NzkwMzkzNjQ=,Only change one region of the sequence? ,CLOSED,2019-08-09T15:16:39Z,2019-08-13T02:48:42Z,2019-08-13T02:48:42Z,"Hi, 

Thank you again so much for your awesome software! I was wondering if there's a way to only modify a region of the seed sequence when running gradient ascent (i.e. of a 60 nt sequence, only update the first 30 nt and leave the rest unchanged)? Is there an option for this or a way to incorporate into the loss function? 

Thanks for your help! ",collinskatie,https://github.com/johli/seqprop/issues/2

Thanks for this great software. I was trying to reproduce the results for the dragoNN experiments. In all cases, I am receiving the following error:

I_kwDOCxt-4c51FeUy,ATG motif penalty in 5'UTR generation,OPEN,2023-10-26T21:06:09Z,2023-10-26T21:06:09Z,,"Hi, thanks for providing such a cool framework to the community. However, I have a few questions during the generation of 5'UTRs. For some reason, I would like to avoid generating sequences with the `ATG` start codon motif, and I used `Optimus50` (for 50nt sequences) rather than the evaluation model shown in the tutorial (for 54nt sequences). 
But actually in both scenarios, it always generated sequences with `ATG`s, and in the original BMC Bioinfo paper, the designed 5'UTRs always have `ATG` motifs. 

I also noticed the punish ATG function:
```python
def get_punish_atg(pwm_start, pwm_end) :
    def punish(pwm) :
        atg_score = K.sum(pwm[..., pwm_start:pwm_end-2, 0, 0] * pwm[..., pwm_start+1:pwm_end-1, 3, 0] * pwm[..., pwm_start+1:pwm_end-1, 2, 0], axis=-1)
        return atg_score
    return punish
```
but I didn't quite get the position dimension for the 3rd nt G: `pwm[..., pwm_start+1:pwm_end-1, 2, 0]`, shouldn't it be `pwm[..., pwm_start+2:pwm_end, 2, 0]`?

In this case, would it penalize the `ATG` ONLY at the end of the sequence or it would penalize all possible `ATG` motifs along the sequences? I also try to add high weight scalar for this `seq_loss` term corresponding to ATG penalty, but it still generates sequences with ATGs.

Thanks in advance for your time. ",hongruhu,https://github.com/johli/seqprop/issues/5
