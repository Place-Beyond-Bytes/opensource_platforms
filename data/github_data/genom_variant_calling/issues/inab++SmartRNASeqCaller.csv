MDU6SXNzdWU0MTMyODg5MjM=,How to prepare resource files for hg38 ?,CLOSED,2019-02-22T08:11:23Z,2019-11-21T09:03:58Z,2019-03-13T08:57:43Z,"Dear developers,
Thanks for the workflow.
My dataset is aligned to hg38 but not hg19.
I was wondering that is that possible to apply the classification model for hg38 . If so, how to prepare resource files for the whole workflow, especifially for the splice4bp and rnaedit files ?

I used your nextflow workflow from here:
https://github.com/inab/RDConnect_RNASeq

to generate a gatk vcf file to be used as input to SmartRNASeqCaller.

The final output from running RDConnect_RNASeq is:
Step8_out.filtered.g.vcf

which contains PASS variants along with all those with filter fields set to non-pass values.

If I use this as input to SmartRNASeqCaller, it ends up selecting some non-pass variants as 'ok' variants.

Should we be running SmartRNASeqCaller on only the PASS variants from this vcf file?

thanks!",brianjohnhaas,https://github.com/inab/SmartRNASeqCaller/issues/4

I noticed that if the genome being used includes 'chr' in the chromosome identifiers, the various filters aren't working, such as splice adjacency, repeat masker overlap, etc., as none of the resource files contain 'chr' identifiers and none of the resulting 'bed intersect' calls find overlaps.

Genomes downloaded from GENCODE all contain 'chr' identifiers, and this breaks compatibility.",brianjohnhaas,https://github.com/inab/SmartRNASeqCaller/issues/6

When trying to run SmartRNASeqCaller using docker and nextflow, I get the following error at the final step. Not sure if the error is coming from the Rscript command or the split_vcf.py command. I believe it is from the Rscript command. Can you please tell me how I can go about solving this issue.

Thanks!

I have two questions:
1. As you mentioned, this software used GATK best practise vcf file as input, but in your pipeline it is also used bam file. So this bam file in which step GATK best practise created? or just first step mapping bam is OK? 
2. I have run to predict_variants.R script. It always print ""Error: both model and input file need to be specified.
Execution halted"". Below is output files before this step. Could you help how to correct it?
Thank you!
