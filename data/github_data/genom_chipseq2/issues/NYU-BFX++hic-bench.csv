When we ran pipeline-execute command. It popped up the following error. Our cluster doesn't use OGS/ Grid Engine 2011.11 as scheduler, we use PBS to schedule jobs and msub to submit jobs. Would this be the reason? if it is, how would you recommend to deal with this situation?

Thanks!

`source ./code/code.main/scripts-read-job-vars $branch ""$objects"" ""genome genome_dir""`

But then you are just scanning the directory manually, so you are ignoring them.

Simple example where this makes a difference:
All the peak counts are currently reported, including inputs, which doesn’t really make sense. Inputs should be ignored. It looks like you used the chipseq-diffbind step as an example (there is still chipseq-diffbind code in there). If you check the chipseq-diffbind step, it ignores the inputs.

I think the relevant part is the `foreach obj ($objects)` loop.

This pipeline looks great for running Hi-C analyses--just wondering, do you currently or do you expect to in the future have support for other HPC cluster workload managers? My cluster uses SLURM and scientific linux and I've been having a difficult time getting it to work there. Would I just (hopefully) need to modify all the qsub options and commands in the qsub files in /code.main to be their equivalent SLURM commands? The other big difference I'd see is in loading of the modulefiles and what is available, but I think it's much easier to work around that.

2. The `find-consistent-domains.pl` can generate the sample1 specific TAD files, sample2 specific and common TAD files. And then you use this different type TAD domain to calculate the TAD activity and TAD activity expression?
