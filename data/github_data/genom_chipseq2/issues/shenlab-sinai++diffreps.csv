What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Running DiffReps over a regular Chip-Seq-Dataset

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
After taking a look into the respective output.txt I observe many entries with 
a log2FC-value of 'inf' or '-inf', respectively instead of a normal value (e.g. 
+/- 1.8). Such an entry does hardly yield any information.

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
Latest Version of DiffReps. Running on Ubuntu.

MDU6SXNzdWUyOTY0NTQ2Mzc=,MACS2 peak calling and diffreps,OPEN,2018-02-12T17:10:24Z,2018-02-12T17:11:46Z,,"Hello, we've been using diffreps to assess differential binding between two conditions in a Chip-seq analysis, thank you for the work. Additionally, we have performed macs2 peak calling at each condition

The issue is macs2 peaks rarely overlap with diffreps output regions (we've been observing 10% overlap of macs2 peaks at certain windows), and thus we were wondering whether diffrep regions are relevant enriched regions at each condition.

As we have background files available for each condition, diffreps output is providing Treatment.enr and Ctrl.enr columns. Even applying a threshold here (e.g. 2 Fold Change) the coincidence with significant macs2 peaks is low. Do you have any recommendation on what threshold to apply or how to proceed at this point?
The aim is to identify regions with differential binding activity, but also assess that these regions are relevant at each condition.

Hope you have any comment on this.
Thank you for your time ",josruirod,https://github.com/shenlab-sinai/diffreps/issues/7

I am using DiffReps on a deeply sequenced histone ChIP-seq data set with 6 replicates per condition.

Question 1:
In the report.txt, I find that 1% of the ""differential"" sites have a log2FC and winFC of 0 (but still an assignment for UP and DOWN) and many others have very very small fold changes. Why are these sites included? Is it ok to filter them out or is this the result of a bug to begin with?

Question 2:
The default hotspot analysis also includes the sites with 0 and very small FC. Would you advise against filtering the report.txt and rerunning the analysis because these sites have some value somehow?

Thank you for the help, it is much appreciated!

I_kwDOAe1IrM5M0R5F,Question about ChIP-seq library fragment size parameter,OPEN,2022-06-29T13:58:34Z,2022-06-29T13:58:34Z,,"Hello
We are using diffReps in a project where we care only about the 5' ends of the BAM file mates. We would like to know how exactly the --frag option is handled by diffReps. It is not ChIP-seq data, so we want NO read extension and NO read shifting, those concepts don't apply here.

It is not very clear from the documentation and I have to admit that the code from [MyShortRead.pm](https://github.com/shenlab-sinai/diffreps/blob/master/lib/MyShortRead/MyShortRead.pm) was too difficult for me to understand. The help states ""ChIP-seq library fragment size. Use to shift read positions."" 
Are BED file elements shifted (new_start=original_start + frag ; new_end=original_end + frag) or are they extended by the indicated amount (new_start=original_start ; new_end=original_end+frag) or are they extended so that the final element size matches the value of frag (new_start=original_start ; new_end=original_start+frag), or something else perhaps?

For instance, if I use a BED file that represents the 5' end of reads (each row of the BED file describes a 1 base pair long element) and I set --frag=0, how will this be handled by diffReps? My desire is that diffReps only counts those 1 base pair positions.

Thanks
Alex
