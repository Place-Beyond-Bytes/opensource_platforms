MDU6SXNzdWU5NTY2NDk3Nzk=,Negative sample generator can return positive samples and isn't GC matched.,OPEN,2021-07-30T11:12:53Z,2021-07-30T11:12:53Z,,"The [function](https://github.com/kundajelab/mseqgen/blob/8078f4057f641d89c9f8a5501e8836af6602e1b1/mseqgen/generators.py#L511) to generate negative (non-peak) input sequences randomly samples across all chromosomes. 
Issues:
- You can get a positive sample because peak regions are not excluded.
- There's no GC-matching.

The parameter that controls negative sampling in the [basepairmodels repo](https://github.com/kundajelab/basepairmodels) is: ```negative-sampling-rate```. 
If the basepairmodels repo is intended for training only on peak regions or with user-specified negative regions, this parameter shouldn't exist. A temporary fix would be to output a warning when the user selects a ```negative-sampling-rate```>0.
