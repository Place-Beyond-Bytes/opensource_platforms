I am trying to use the program, but somehow it is always reporting the error message:

I have tried with other samples and get the same error. Could you help me with this issue?

thank you for an interesting and complete tool. We are testing this tool with many of our Chip libraries, but have been having issues obtaining the final results from our data.
We have 3M paired end reads from different libraries and their control inputs and we are submitting the drompaplus pipeline in this fashion:
```
parse2wig+ --pair -p 8 -i Input.bam -o input48 --gt /scratch/jmontenegro/nvectensis/data/refs/nemVec2.genometable.txt -n GR --nrpm 3000000 --ncmp 3000000
parse2wig+ --pair -p 8 -i mef2.bam -o Mef2 --gt /scratch/jmontenegro/nvectensis/data/refs/nemVec2.genometable.txt -n GR --nrpm 3000000 --ncmp 3000000
```
The bigwig files are produced correctly and then I use those to try to generate plots. However, I get many error which I guess depend on the GTF annotation file I am using.
Does drompa+ requires 'tss' features annotated to generate a TSS PROFILE graphs? After running the tool:
drompa+ PROFILE -i Mef.bw -o aroundTSS -g tcs.gtf --gftype 1 --norm 1
and the tsv files look empty:
```
> cat aroundTSS.PROFILE.averaged.ChIPread.Mef2.100.bw.tsv
	-2500	-2400	-2300	-2200	-2100	-2000	-1900	-1800	-1700	-1600	-1500	-1400	-1300	-1200	-1100	-1000	-900	-800	-700	-600	-500	-400	-300	-200	-100	0	100	200	300	400	500	600	700	800	900	1000	1100	1200	1300	1400	1500	1600	1700	1800	1900	2000	2100	2200	2300	2400	2500
```
Would this be because there are no explicit TSS features in the GTF file? Also, when I try to run PC_ENRICH I get a warning that no 'genes' can be found in the genome. Nevertheless, there are gene features in the gtf file so I am not sure why it cannot find genes in any chromosome:
```

What are the required features that can be understood by drompa+ in a gtf file?

I am trying to install DROMPAplus on a fairly restricted HPC system (no Singularity, Centos 7, etc.). I attempted to build your package using conda env with the required libraries/gcc/cmake etc. installed, but the build still fails at the cmake stage:

```
CMake Error at

Debugging some slightly non-conventional setup may be more tricky than trying to create a proper conda package.
Do you plan to package DROMPAplus using conda?

Hi @rnakato,

I am currently learning to use the programs included in the `ssp_drompa` Docker image and have a couple of questions about `drompa_peakcall`:

1. Should the value assigned to `-width4lmd <int>` be reduced when running `drompa_peakcall` (either `PC_SHARP` or `PC_BROAD`) with *S. cerevisiae* ChIP-seq data? If so, what value do you recommend? The default of `100000` bp seems large given the relatively small sizes of *S. cerevisiae* chromosomes.
2. Is the file to be supplied to `-mp <mappability file>` the same as the mappability table used by SSP—i.e., a tab-separated text file describing the chromosome name and its corresponding number of mappable bases like below?
```txt
I	201288
II	784032
