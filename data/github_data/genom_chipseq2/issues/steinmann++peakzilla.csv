MDU6SXNzdWUxODk2MjgyNjA=,about ChIP-exo paired bed files,CLOSED,2016-11-16T08:27:48Z,2017-03-01T07:00:23Z,2017-03-01T07:00:23Z,"Dear Jonas,

Thank you for coding such a great tool for peak calling. It will greatly
contribute to my graduate project.

I would like to ask couple questions. I would like to process a public GEO
dataset that contains chip-exo data. Each sample contains two bed files (
for paired ends reads). therefore can I use peakzilla to call peaks as it
was  advertised in the abstract of peakzilla paper ? If so could you
describe me how ? because in github tutorial there is only single end read
run is shown.

Best regards,

Greetings for the day !!!

I have chip-exo data.  To call peak, I am planning to used peakzilla. 
Before trying out on our lab data, my boss wants me to replicate the result published in peakzilla paper.

I have three bam file for three replicates of CTCF data from Rhee and Pugh,2011. I run Peakzilla with default parameter,

Below are the results I got

But in publication, you have mentioned  36 bp peak and 60 smallest peak to peak distance.

I think it may be the peakzilla version which I am using is different than used during publication.

Can you please explain to me why I am getting such results.

Command used:

python ~/Tools/peakzilla-master/peakzilla.py input.bed >$out""s1_peaks.tsv""

Best Regards,
Sudhir
