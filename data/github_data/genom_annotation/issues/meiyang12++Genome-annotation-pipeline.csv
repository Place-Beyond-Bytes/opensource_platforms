I_kwDOFEf9is5KQ2XU,How different methods on RepeatMasker running can lead to different results,OPEN,2022-05-24T03:28:39Z,2022-05-24T03:28:39Z,,"Hi! Thank you for providing this pipline to annotate a new assembling genome!

I run RepeatMasker on different libraries ( one is build by RepeatModeler, another is 'species' contained in the RepBase ) according to your command, but I add the parameter `-xsmall [returns repetitive regions in lowercase (rest capitals) rather than masked]` because I notice it is recommended that the braker runs on genomic sequences that have been softmasked for Repeats. And also the option `--softmasking` is suitable for softmasked genomes. The command looks like this:
```
RepeatMasker -pa 20 -lib 01_repeatModeler-denovo-repeat.lib/RM_*/consensi.fa.classified -html -gff -xsmall -dir 02_delete-denovo-lib-result genome.fa &>RepeatMasker_run.log1
RepeatMasker -pa 20 -species ""Lepidoptera"" -html -gff -xsmall -dir 03_delete-repeatmasker-lib-result 02_delete-denovo-lib-result/genome.fa.masked &>RepeatMasker_run.log2
RepeatMasker -pa 20 -species ""Lepidoptera"" -html -gff -xsmall -noint -dir 04_delete-repeamasker-noint-result 03_delete-repeatmasker-lib-result/genome.fa.masked.masked &>RepeatMasker_run.log3
```
I have compared the two masked genome generated by run 1 & 2, I see some sequences that is masked in the first run (with `-lib`) is unmasked in the second run (with `-species`). I think this case is caused by the option `-xsmall`, so I run again above commands but delete the option `-xsmall` and this problem is solved.

It is confusing that this pipeline use the genome.fa.masked.masked in `03_delete-repeatmasker-lib-result/genome.fa.masked.masked` directory rather than the genome.fa.masked.masked.masked in `04_delete-repeamasker-noint-result/genome.fa.masked.masked.masked` directory to run BRAKER. 

So what the meaning of run 3 ( with `-noint` ) ? If we run RepeatMasker in hardmasking model, I think the `braker.pl` shouldn't add the option `--softmasking`. If we run RepeatMasker in softmasking model, does the better way is to combine the libraries into one library as mentioned by jebrosen https://github.com/Dfam-consortium/TETools/issues/20#issuecomment-983927917 and then feed the genome.fa.masked ( soft-masking ) to BRAKER with `--softmasking` ?",yshcai,https://github.com/meiyang12/Genome-annotation-pipeline/issues/3
