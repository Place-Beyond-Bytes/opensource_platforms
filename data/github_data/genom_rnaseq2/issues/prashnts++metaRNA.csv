With `gcc`, `fopenmp` flag is required, however it is different within different compilers.

@devkhan or @pragyajaiswal could you try and reproduce? It builds and passes tests just fine on OSX.

I guess the resource is not available. For resolution I would suggest using the below command
`wget http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/download/sourcecode/2_2_x/ViennaRNA-2.2.10.tar.gz`
which I think is the most recent stable version.

Various stackoverflow posts suggests to install python-dev but that didnt really work for me.

So I looked at conda and then I could install it successfully.
My suggestion would be to have documentation for installing using conda as well.

This is my first visit to this fine repo, but it seems you have been working hard to keep all dependencies updated so far.

Once you have closed this issue, I'll create seperate pull requests for every update as soon as I find one.

That's it for now!

Happy merging! 🤖
