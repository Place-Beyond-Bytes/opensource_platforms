MDU6SXNzdWU2ODgxMjg5Mjg=,Use the read config class to handle configuration in the data preparation step,CLOSED,2020-08-28T14:48:46Z,2020-10-22T02:43:21Z,2020-10-22T02:43:21Z,"In `./functions/readConfig.py`

New methods are required:
- [x] Add test for checking if the provided config file exist
- [x] Functions to set `data_dir`, `chunksize` and `tolerance`
- [x] Functions to retrieve sources for GWAS, Gencode, Cytobands etc.
- [x] Functions to update data source versions and filenames.
- [x] A function is needed to save the updated config file.

In `./Prepare_data.py`

Update:
- [x] Use readConfigy to extract hardcoded parameters.
- [x] Use methods to update parameters in configuration
- [x] Use methods to save updated config file.
