```

../gsl/math.c:56:1: error: redefinition of ‘gsl_complex_rect’

Makefile:109: recipe for target '../gsl/math.o' failed

```

The problem seems to be how inline functions are treated in the header and the code. I tried adding -std=c99 and -DGSL_C99_INLINE to CFLAGS in the Makefiles, but neither helped.

I also tried an older version of the compiler (gcc-5 (Debian 5.4.1-1) 5.4.1 20160803), again with the same error. The problem does not seem to be distro-related as I am getting these errors under Arch Linux too.

Any idea how to tackle that?

and then it quits after a minute. If I reduce the `-p` to 30 it keeps on going.

Also, how are deadzones computed? There are blazingly fast kmer-counters out there, I might be able to throw together a script for computing deadzones using one of them if you could explain how you do it.

This should not be provided as input, but the algorithm should be able to handle non-overlapping intervals even if they should have been merged due to covering adjacent positions. The cause in my case was incorporating unassembled regions without merging intervals. This should be fixed in both the deadzones program and in rseg, specifically in how the deadzones are loaded for adjusting the scaling factors.",andrewdavidsmith,https://github.com/smithlabcode/rseg/issues/4

I do not know what this error message means and it seems that other users have had issues with that in the past (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rseg-support/rR1K9HqEs-8). Any ideas on what that could be?

I am interested in following the methodology of this paper (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28650485/) using RSEG to call peaks. 

This group found the RSEG sums flanking 100kb from the center of super enhancers to perform unsupervised clustering analysis. Is RSEG capable of making these calculations?

If not, any help in identifying a program that is able to do this is appreciated.

Thank you!",mkunika,https://github.com/smithlabcode/rseg/issues/8
