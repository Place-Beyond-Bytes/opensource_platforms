MDU6SXNzdWUxMTAyOTY5MDg=,Easier Install using Python Virtual Environment,CLOSED,2015-10-07T19:14:22Z,2015-10-16T06:11:25Z,2015-10-16T06:11:25Z,"Hi, just a quick comment.  You can build this package using virtual environment without needing to use --user for the pip install or needing super-user permissions.

git clone git://github.com/tszalay/poreseq.git
virtualenv VE-PORESEQ
. VE-PORESEQ/bin/activate
pip install numpy
pip install cython
pip install h5py
cd poreseq
pip install -e .

Also, not everyone has h5py in their system python or local python by default, so I included it in the pip install.

Thanks

MDU6SXNzdWUxMTM5MDgwMDc=,poreseq consensus error,OPEN,2015-10-28T19:50:45Z,2015-11-18T17:12:24Z,,"Hi Authors - 

I have using poreseq to error correct and assemble minion data for a bacterial genome.

I have a fasta file generated from the fast5 files. I ran it through the first step which is alignment and it ran fine and I got a bam file from it. I then ran consensus using the fasta file, alignment bam file, and pointed it to  directory which contains all of the fast5 files. When I run it I get the following error messages,

MDU6SXNzdWUxNDUwOTEwODU=,Error Correction with multiple dataset,OPEN,2016-04-01T05:39:02Z,2016-04-04T04:01:23Z,,"Dear Tamas,

I am thinking of doing a denovo assembly of E.coli using the assembler CANU. As setting up a pipeline, I came to think of merging CANU, with poreseq for error correcting the assembly.

I am taking the 4 datasets and combining into one Highquality2D dataset and running the Assembly. So basically I am merging 4 datasets. Can you please enlighten me whether should I error correct the assembled data(after assembly) with each data set individually, and use the error corrected data as the input for the next error correction and continue 4 times the error correction? Or is it possible to give the path to all the 4 data sets of fast5 folders and do it one shot.

I hope you got my idea.

Thanks in advance.

I'm trying to use PoreSeq to perform error correction without reference, but I got an empty fasta file after the 'poreseq consensus' step, no error was reported in the log file. I didn't exactly follow the instructions, for I couldn't get fasta sequence in the extraction step, which I suspect was due to the hard-coded file path. I got my allreads.fasta by converting fastq to fasta, and I skipped the split step. I have no problem in the alignment step, and I checked the bam file and it looks fine. I wonder what caused the empty corrected fasta file. Your help will be highly appreciated.
