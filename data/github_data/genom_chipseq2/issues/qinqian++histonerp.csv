I_kwDOJj1YC86ZHby1,how the annotation_TSS is made,CLOSED,2024-10-06T19:53:01Z,2024-10-08T15:47:58Z,2024-10-08T15:47:57Z,"Hi Alvin,
Thanks for pointing me to this repo! I heard you met my current boss Steven at the Broad Depmap conference. Small world!

I have a question on how the annotation_TSS file is made.

```
chr1    11873   11874   NR_046018:DDX11L1       0       +
chr1    17436   17437   NR_107063:MIR6859-3     0       -
chr1    17436   17437   NR_128720:MIR6859-4     0       -
```
It looks like you are using RefSeq transcripts.  Given a single gene has multiple transcripts, how did you handle it?

Thanks!
Hope all is well at Broad.
