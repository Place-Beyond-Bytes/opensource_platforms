This function calculates the N50 values for a Genome assembly. The N50 value is calculated by first ordering every contig/scaffold by length from longest to shortest(Descending order). Next, starting from the longest contig/scaffold, the lengths of each contig are summed, until this running sum equals one-half of the total length of all contigs/scaffolds in the assembly. Then the length of shortest contig/scaffold in this list is the N50 value. I have used random function to generate a Random genome of 10, 000 base pairs. Similarly random fragments of variable fragment length were generated  for assembly.",2022-06-11T17:39:33Z,tavleenbajwa8
