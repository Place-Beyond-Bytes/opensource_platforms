I_kwDOAyU7h84_DDqg,ERROR: Expected output file pf_variant_calling_pipeline/data/qc/data_fastqc.zip  in stage fastqc_unmapped (CBK17) could not be found,OPEN,2021-11-18T20:23:11Z,2021-11-18T20:23:11Z,,"Hi,

I am trying to call variant for Plasmodium falciparum samples but I am getting this error:
**ERROR: Expected output file pf_variant_calling_pipeline/data/qc/data_fastqc.zip  in stage fastqc_unmapped (CBK17) could not be found**
my command is : 
`bpipe-0.9.10/bin/bpipe run -n 4 pipeline.groovy Fastq1/CBK17_001_R1.fastq.gz Fastq2/CBK17_001_R2.fastq.gz`

I've tried to understand the script since I'm not familiar with bpipe, but I don't know how I could change it so it will consider the output from the first command as input for the **fastqc_unmapped** stage.

Could you please tell me how this error can be fixed?

Cheers",mfdiop,https://github.com/bahlolab/pf_variant_calling_pipeline/issues/4
