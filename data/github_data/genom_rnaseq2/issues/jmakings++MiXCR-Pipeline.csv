Please, consider updating to MiXCR 4.1, as it has many fixes, including postanalysis:

https://github.com/milaboratory/mixcr/releases/tag/v4.1.0

We also added separate [rigorous integration tests](https://github.com/milaboratory/mixcr/blob/develop/itests/case016.py) for all downstream analysis routines, and the results for all measures are already tested in many experiments. QC plots are also available in 4.1. Let us know if you'll find any issues or bugs and we'll fix them. Thx!",PoslavskySV,https://github.com/jmakings/MiXCR-Pipeline/issues/1
