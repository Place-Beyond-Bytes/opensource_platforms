I_kwDOG73WaM5UDuiy,FEAT: Support genes annotations correction after fixing potential frameshifts,OPEN,2022-10-15T19:05:30Z,2022-10-15T20:34:26Z,,"At the moment, the tool is capable of detecting potential indels that may be causing ORF interruption(s) due frameshift(s) and then output a VCF with modifications to possible fix it. The next step, involving applying the VCF variants to the reference in order to get the corrected genomic sequence, is done by external tools such as `bcftools consensus`. After that, a new annotation file (i.e. gff and/or tbl) have to be generated by running external genome annotation tools. However, as far as i'm concern, we don't have to reannotate the corrected genome sequence.

A way to overcome this is by fixing the original genome annotation in those annotation features where frameshifts were located. Furthermore, literature shows that some indels leading to stop-codons within an ORF may be caused by true variants, particularly in fewer prokaryotes species [1]. This bacterial evolutionary event is known as ORF pseudogenisation. My proposals are (1) correct original annotations by lifting over annotation features positions from reference (initial genome sequence) to new genome sequence (i.e. after applying VCF variants), (2) if corrected gene annotation still leads to truncated protein annotate it with pseudogene tag and (3) output GFF3 following NCBI genbank genome submission guidelines [2].
