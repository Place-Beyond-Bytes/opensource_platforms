I_kwDOFK_SSM5yGnpB,Can your pipeline be used for paired end reads with gaps?,CLOSED,2023-09-26T21:34:49Z,2024-11-13T17:28:36Z,2024-11-13T17:28:36Z,"Hello,

I am interested to confirm an allele frequency for a SNV in BRAF gene using amplicon sequencing data. The length of amplicon is 271bp, and paired reads are 101X2. So there is a gap between them. I am wondering whether your pipeline can be used in my case? I see your input is one bam file, what tools/steps do you recommend to align the fastq files to reference genome?

Thank you very much,

Thanks for the great workflow. I'm about to test the tool but wanted to know that if it is okay to exclude `AmpliconStart` and `AmpliconEnd` (not avail for us)

Is there any work around for this? Or would it be okay if I add some arbitrary bps for primer sequences and try it?

Best,
