Thank you for sharing Your pipeline. You mention in the code several dependencies including Lush_aligner, LUSH_toolkit-BQSR-V2.2, LUSH_toolkit-HC-V1.2.2, LUSH_toolkit-GenotypeGVCFs-V1.1.0. Are they somewhere available to download? Also, could you explain the meaning of the Lush_aligner parameters: ""-n 0.1 -J 0.5 -l 12 -g 2 -b 2 -M -Y""?

Thank you for creating this much-needed faster implementation for variant calling. 

I wanted to validate the accuracy of the vcf generated by LUSH-DNAseq-pipeline using Haplotype_Comparison.sh. However hap.py script required by Haplotype_Comparison.sh is missing. Can you please provide the same?

Cheers,

Anurag

Can the GenomicDB workspace be used as input for the LUSH_GenotypeGVCFs module instead of a combined multi-sample GVCF?
