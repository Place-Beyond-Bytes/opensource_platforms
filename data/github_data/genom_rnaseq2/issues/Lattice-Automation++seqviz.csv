Translations are absent from SeqViz. Are a way to visualize translated amino acid sequences. Should be exposed via something similar to the annotations schema.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
- [x] Be able to programmatically specify a translated region through a ""translations"" property on input
- [ ] Be able to infer which open reading frames are large enough to automatically have translations shown (with a programmatically exposed default parameter)

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Only ambiguity here is around:

1. automatic inference open reading frames that should be translated (based on length, or length as a ratio of full sequence, or whether the sequence is just a single ORF)?
2. whether we also want an ORF toggle. I put ORFs (different from translations) in Loom but that wasn't ported over either

**Additional context**
I already made this in Loom's sequence viewer, see screenshot below, but it wasn't copied over when parts of that viewer were made open-source.

Rather than `part` being a catch-all for an object, accession, iGEM name, etc. might be easier if SeqViz accepts _either_ an NCBI accession/iGEM id as ""accession"" string prop, or each of the `part` properties independently. Example:

OR

I was running into some trouble with annotations when giving the SeqViz component a Genbank file to read. The visualization appears correctly, but none of the annotations have the proper name parsed from the Genbank file, instead labeled as something like ""CDS-648"".

After doing some digging in `io/parsers/genbank.js`, I think I've found the cause of the issue. On line 189 of `io/parsers/genbank.js`, new annotations are given the default name `${type}-${start}`, however this introduces a bug later on. In line 211 of `io/parsers/genbank.js`, as part of the defensive check to see if a name isn't already defined for the annotation, it checks if `annotations[annotations.length - 1].name === ""Untitled""`. This will never be true, since the default name given is something like ""CDS-648"", so none of the annotations ever get a proper name set.

I propose that either the default name given is ""Untitled"" on line 189 of `io/parsers/genbank.js`, or the condition `annotations[annotations.length - 1].name === ""Untitled""` on line 211 of `io/parsers/genbank.js` is removed.

in that way the enzymesCustom ""TestEC"" would displayed only between position 5 to 15 and 20 to 30 (if there is a match), no wsearch would mean search in whole sequence. Is that possible?

I'm having a lot of fun building an application around it. I have come across a small bug when clicking on a plasmid annotation. The seqviz docs explain that the object emitted following an annotation click should look like this:

`{
  // selection
  ""name"": ...
  ""type"": ... 
  ""seq"": ... 
  ""gc"": ... 
  ""tm"": ... 
  ""start"": ...
  ""end"": ... 
  ""length"": ...
  ""direction"": ...
  ""clockwise"": ...
  ""color"": ...
}`

however object I am capturing looks like this:

`{
clockwise: ...
element: ...
end: ...
gc: ...
length: ...
ref: ...
seq: ...
start: ...
tm: ...
type: ...
}`

I am creating my seqviz annotation objects with this shape:

`const seqVizAnnotation = {
            id: qualifiers.standard_name + makeId(1),
            start: location.intervals[0].start,
            end: location.intervals[0].end,

            color: translateColors(feature.type),
            type: feature.type
          }`

I noticed that in SeqViz repo file `src/utils/sequence.js>annotationFactory:221` that the id and color property have default values, however if I remove the id and color property from the `seqVizAnnotation` object I pass to the viewer, the viewer will not render ids, colors, or proper keys on the rendered elements. If I include the id and color, then that value is mapped to the ""ref"" and the viewer is fixed, but I am unable to capture the name of an annotation when I click on it. In order to hack my way around these issues I am using the id property in the `seqVizAnnotation` object for the UID of each annotation and as the ""name"" for an annotation that has been clicked on. 

I believe that refactoring `setSelection` in `src/SeqViz/handlers/selection.jsx:354-375` could alter the object that is actually emitted when an annotation is clicked on to match what the docs say I should be returning. ",crudnicky,https://github.com/Lattice-Automation/seqviz/issues/99

For exact matches, the code uses a regex with gi -- this explicitly means one is allowed to search case-insensitively. In addition, it does not place any restrictions on the alphabet you use. It's unclear to me whether there's a secondary bug relating to the fact that I'm not sure the code is handling wildcards here.

But for mismatches, the code is absolutely handling wildcards. Unfortunately, the code also tightly restricts the algorithm to the alphabet used, and worse, it doesn't accept case-insensitive matches. The result is that if one uses all caps DNA sequences, the mismatch-allowing search returns every possible substring as a match.

This is incorrect. My plan is to fork, fix this issue, and submit it as a pull request.

I noticed in my application that despite sending the correct props to SeqViz, certain plasmid maps were rendering the incorrect start and stop indexes for the annotations. I found that this was due to incoming annotations using the previous plasmid's sequence length in the `parseAnnotations()` function (`SeqViz.jsx` line 138).  In the `componentDidUpdate()` hook, when the previous props are destructed, the sequence length of the previous plasmid is extracted. This value is then passed into the `parseAnnotations()`function with **the current annotations**. I believe that the **current sequence** should be used instead of the prior sequence so that an accurate calculation of the annotation start / stop index can be made.

I have cloned a local copy of seqviz and used `npm link` to generate a symlink between the local seqviz and my application. When I change line `SeqViz.jsx` line 138 from

`this.setState({ annotations: this.parseAnnotations(this.props.annotations, seq) });`

As we use this sequence visualizer, we have found a few usecases where it would be very helpful to be able to show multiple custom-highlighted areas of a sequence. One of these usecases is related to restriction enzymes. While the built-in restriction enzyme feature is extremely useful, we have gotten feedback from our biologist folks that they would really like to be able to easily see just the recognition site of an enzyme in addition to the cut site. I've attached an image of what I am referring to below.

Another usecase for the ability to highlight areas of a sequence is in cases where we would like to show to the user certain problematic areas of a sequence, such as areas that have too low of gc content. Currently the best solution we have found to this is changing the color of the bases at those indices, but that is not very easy to see:

<img width=""214"" alt=""Screen Shot 2021-09-20 at 12 13 27 PM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91080861/134036708-bd642c62-d3f0-4195-9f95-8b7076af8fb6.png"">

if we were able to use something similar to the search highlighting functionality, but to highlight any arbitrary number of sections of the sequence at some given indices, we could solve both of these problems (and there would probably be other applications as well).

If there is already some workaround we could use to do this, please let us know. Otherwise, we would love to see this added to the visualizer!

First of all, thank you for this awesome tool!
I'm using the React SeqViz component to display nucleotide sequences but I would also like to display, in the same component, my own amino acid sequences instead of the translated version provided by seqviz. I tried to input my amino acid sequence in the ""seq"" prop but the spacing between each AA is quite irregular and specially problematic with the I's (see attached).
I'm wondering if there is any easy fix for this... Perhaps a prop for custom AA sequences plus one to turn off the display of nucleotides or a boolean AA sequence prop that would adjust the spacing in case the input sequence is AA?

Looking forward to hearing your feedback.
Thanks,
Daniel

Note: I did change the CSS style of the component but I believe that is not what is causing the issue since nucleotides work fine.

I'm not sure if this is a bug or a feature, but I noticed that---when clicking on the same annotation---the onSelection() function was not getting executed multiple times.

This poses an issue for my use of the Sequence Viewer for the following reason:

- I have state that tracks the selected annotation
- The onSelection() function I pass to the Sequence Viewer sets that state
- I have a button that clears the selected annotation that was stored in state
- So if I select an annotation -> the onSelection gets executed as expected and sets the annotation in state -> but if I then select the button to clear the selection -> then click the same annotation again -> the onSelection() function is not getting executed (so the selection is not getting set in state)
- the work around seems to be that I need to click another annotation first before again clicking the desired annotation

**Expected behavior**

- My expectation was that the onSelection() would get executed again and the annotation would get stored as the selected annotation again.

Many app developers will already do file parsing (eg: upload a Genbank) within their app, and then use SeqViz simply to render it.

From Justin at GenomeMiner:

> it would be cool if it was written in a web component exportable way (like is possible using svelte where you can compile to a web component, and maybe some other way thats possible besides svelte ??) so that it could be used in any JS project without having to use React. I moved on from React awhile ago code in Vue or Svelte primarily so in order to use seqviz I wrap it in React runtime just to use it w/ vue/svelte.

I was also kicking around Stencil: https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil

Obviously, Vue is ascendant, and Svelte too, so I can definitely see a strong argument for this if SeqViz is meant to have longevity. We provide a thin wrapper around the React implementation right now, but there are emergent frameworks that make it easy to compile across implementations

This has been our most important request so far. The circular view is great because it gives an overview of the full sequence. However, it's circular, which should only represent plasmids. We would LOVE a similar linear view, similar to what Snapgene does (does really well btw).

This would also largely solve viewing much bigger sequences, such as organisms where scrolling through millions of bp is unfeasible.

Currently SeqViz has AA-support which nicely translates into proteins in the view, however, we have files that does not have the AA-sequence pre-translation but only the protein. And since there's no way for us to translate back to AA we cannot really use SeqViz for visualising these.

We mostly use SeqViz with genbank files and have noticed that annotation parsing is off without us being able to really figure out why/how to fix it in the files. I can try to find an example for you we can share (hard because it's mainly customer IP we're working with). But the same file in SeqViz and in Snapgene render differently and it results in both more, but wrong, annotation shown in SeqViz and fewer/hidden annotations that doesn't appear in SeqViz.

### Visualisation of unassembled strains
Some of the genbank files we have contain multiple strains (typically unassembled reads), which SeqViz by default concatenates the sequences as it was one – which is  wrong and hard to catch. Snapgene let's you select which of the sequences to view, which is what we've now built ourselves too, so that we add a select-step before rendering just one of the sequences in the file with SeqViz.

Maybe add an additional prop to the AnnotationProp called `style`, which would be applied to the corresponding label in the circular view. E.g.:

I'm currently working with `seqviz` in a hobby project to practice/learn a bit and am currently dealing with the `search parameter` of the component. If you are searching for a certain sequence, it can be a bit difficult to determine the number of search hits, depending on the total number of nucleotides.

I would have expected that either directly in the component or in the metadata area, a small display regarding the search hits would be available. If it's already implemented and I just can't find it I apologize in advance.

**Describe your preferred solution. (What)**

Would display something like `4 Search hits for 'ATTT'` inside the component/metadata. Another idea was to add another property to the components search parameter to control the display of this little feature:

```ts
search={{ query: 'ATTT', mismatch: 0 }}
```
to
```ts
search={{ query: 'ATTT', mismatch: 0, displaySearchHits: true }}

I want to be able to render an icon beside the name in an annotation. Some annotations cover sequences that have an identified biological function that can be represented by a symbolic graphic (e.g. SBOL visual).

- I can pass an SVG specification for a **icon** as a parameter to an annotation, similar to the way I pass a text string for a `name` as a parameter to an annotation.
- Like name, a **icon** is an optional parameter. 
- If the **icon** parameter has an SVG value, SeqViz should display the designated icon to the left of the annotation name.
- The icon and name combination should be centered in the annotation
- If no icon is provided, the name alone should be centered in the annotation.

I_kwDOCuv4lc6XNlgf,Cut sites display regions outside recognition sequence as if they were part of recognition sequence,OPEN,2024-09-19T17:02:56Z,2024-09-19T17:02:56Z,,"**Describe the bug**

Cut sites show three important pieces of information in the seq viz sequence - the two cut locations and the sequence that is recognized by the enzyme.

In cases where the cut site extends outside the recognition sequence, the enzyme definitions in SeqViz ""pad out"" the recognition sequence with Ns. For example, the definition of the enzyme BbsI is:
```
  bbsi: {
    fcut: 8,
    name: ""BbsI"",
    rcut: 12,
    rseq: ""GAAGACNNNNNN"",
  },
```

Note that the part of the sequence that's actually recognized by the enzyme is ""GAAGAC"". However, because of the Ns padding the rseq in the enzyme definition, the entire range is shown inside the ""recognition box"" when this is rendered in SeqViz, suggesting that the characters after the ""C"" are part of the recognition site:

<img width=""203"" alt=""Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 11 26 02 AM"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be47f3f7-d86e-4237-899b-2da11683da94"">

We've tried custom definitions of these enzymes which exclude the N's but it seems those are included intentionally - when the cut sites fall off the edge of a sequence, it causes the component to crash.

**Expected behavior**

I'd expect that the ""recognition rectangle"" is drawn around only the part of the sequence that is recognized by the enzyme - in this case, only around GAAGAC, not GAAGACACAGGG.

<img width=""183"" alt=""Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 12 50 57 PM"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fafa62b-b45a-45f5-aac6-62650058eb29"">

I'd expect this to be the case for any enzyme that's currently defined with leading or trailing N's. I know there are also some enzymes with non-N wildcards, or with Ns (or other degenerate nucleotides) in the middle of the recognition sequence.

For example:
```
  banii: {

I'd propose that it's reasonable not to attempt to handle these cases for the moment, and to include any degenerate nucleotides (other than N), or any interior Ns, as part of the displayed recognition sequence.

I_kwDOCuv4lc6XPFOT,Sometimes restriction enzyme recognition/cut site display crashes SeqViz,CLOSED,2024-09-19T20:31:41Z,2024-10-29T13:42:56Z,2024-10-29T13:42:56Z,"Related to #270 

**Describe the bug**

For circular sequences, SeqViz crashes when an enzyme's combined recognition site and cut site sequence span straddles the last `SeqBlock` and first `SeqBlock`. 

This bug was reported within the context of a [related but possibly different issue](https://github.com/Lattice-Automation/seqviz/issues/270):
> ...when the cut sites fall off the edge of a sequence, it causes the component to crash.

**Expected behavior**

If an enzyme's recognition sequence is detected near the end of the final `SeqBlock` and some-or-all the associated cut site is offset from it such that it extends off the end of the final `SeqBlock`, then the cut site should be displayed on the first `SeqBlock`, at the top of the sequence viewer display.

**Additional context**
The reported error occurs at line [178 in elementsToRows.ts](https://github.com/Lattice-Automation/seqviz/blob/803fc901e81a92b452d89715d520d9f358b4ede6/src/elementsToRows.ts#L178)",leshane,https://github.com/Lattice-Automation/seqviz/issues/271

It's pretty annoying because i can't select ranges of residues (the moment you clikc on one the whole sequence gets selected via this blue `translation` flyer). I was looking forward to using the 'linear' version of the viz...

Most modern websites use dark mode. I couldn't find a way to overwrite the colors of text from the component. At minimum it would be nice to be able to pass a variable of colorMode = ""dark"" | ""light"".  
 
<!-- A clear and concise description of the problem statement. -->
When color mode is set to dark, text should be white. When color mode is set to light, text should be black.

I_kwDOCuv4lc6jfabQ,Ticks in the linear viewer are 1 base off,OPEN,2024-12-16T17:00:24Z,2024-12-16T19:19:42Z,,"**Describe the bug**

<!-- What is the bug? -->
Ticks under the sequence in the linear viewer are placed under the wrong base.

For example, the tick labeled ""1"" is under the 1st base which is at index 0.

**Expected behavior**

<!-- What should happen instead? -->

Since everything is 0-based, the tick should either start at 0, or (better?) placed between the 1st and 2nd amino acid.

Maybe something like this:
