I_kwDOKat14c5ygIym,Need a cache to store the bits of RNA data for later retreval,CLOSED,2023-10-01T23:22:29Z,2024-01-21T02:14:56Z,2024-01-21T02:14:56Z,"**As a** user  
**I need** a cache for my rna data
**So that** I can go back and get it later
      
### Details and Assumptions
    * data will come from nupack4 and vienna2
    *  no duplicates rna sequences in a cache     
### Acceptance Criteria     
    -  need to be able to find specific rna data in a cache
    - - need a live mode to access db directly
    -  need a load mode to load db into a python container
    - only one aptamper per cache

**I need** a rna nut oibject  
**So that** I can store all my genomic data about the rna in the nut
      
### Details and Assumptions
    * nuts will be stored in a cache
### Acceptance Criteria     
    gherkin 
    - addressed by rna sequence

I_kwDOKat14c50yTUL,Filter definitions for attribute getter and setter,CLOSED,2023-10-24T14:06:39Z,2024-01-21T02:15:16Z,2024-01-21T02:15:16Z,"**As a** user  
**I need** to be abel to define a custom set of rule for data manipulation 
**So that** I can dynamically route and affect data that is passed through the nut
      
### Details and Assumptions
    * unkown
### Acceptance Criteria     
    gherkin 
    When setter is called data is routed to target specified
    When getter is called data is pulled from source specified
    When setter is called supported values are mutated according to definition
    When getter is called supported values are un-mutated or mutated more according to definition

**I need** to be able to save a class with multiple non-list values 
**So that** I can access it later and then place the data back into the pipeline 
      
### Details and Assumptions
    Data need to allow saveing of data for Serena RNA analysis software     
### Acceptance Criteria     
    Can save data generated from processing of secondary structures and energies in ensemble
