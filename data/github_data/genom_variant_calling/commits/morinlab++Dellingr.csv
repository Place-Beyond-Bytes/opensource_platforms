ProDuSe variants called by snv.py are filtered based upon the following characteristics:

    Strand bias: Variants with significant strand bias are filtered out
    Molecule counts: Each locus is examined to identify molecules with which support a variant. Molecules are examined from the strongest (DPN) to the weakest (Sn and Sp). If there are too few molecules of a given type at a locus, the next molecule type is examined without counting against the variant. Molecule thresholds scale dynamically based upon the characteristics of the capture space. At higher depths, additional weaker bases will be required in order for a variant to pass filters
    Quality filtering of weak bases (Sn, Sp, Dpn)
    Minimum depth: Currently, no minimum depth is required to call a variant, but this option is available",2017-05-01T23:12:23Z,ckrushton
