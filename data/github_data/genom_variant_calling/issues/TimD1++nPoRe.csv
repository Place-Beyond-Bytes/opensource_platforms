Contig header line matches contig in the bam file. This is amplicon data - so only small regions of the entire genome is covered.

Any ideas?

I_kwDOFcXzsc5EkBPX,Clair3 scripts and modifications,CLOSED,2022-02-25T10:34:59Z,2022-07-11T02:22:25Z,2022-07-11T02:22:25Z,"Thanks for sharing this very interesting realignment approach.

I noticed that your `scripts/realign_pipeline.sh` scripts refers to some model training scripts in the `./clair3/` folder that I could not find in the repository. Would you mind sharing these scripts as well?
Also, could you provide more details of the corresponding modifications that you made to Clair3, particularly the haplotype-phased pileup calling (`clair3-hap`) that you describe in your preprint?",ftostevin,https://github.com/TimD1/nPoRe/issues/3
