If there is a fix, we should be able to run it to get correct contamination estimate for tumour sample without re-running the whole Sanger WGS variant calling workflow, will then apply update to ascat_metrics SONG analysis with new result files.

If there is no fix, we should be able to remove contamination result from qc_metrics payload produced by Sanger, this change shouldn't have any impact on Sanger variant calling result at all",junjun-zhang,https://github.com/icgc-argo-workflows/sanger-wgs-variant-calling/issues/12
