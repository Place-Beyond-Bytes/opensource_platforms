Here i have created two classes ConversionToGRCh37.java, ConvertToGRCh37.java.
ConversionToGRCh37.java class is meant for reading .bed file, which is having GRCh38 assembly coordinates, so this code will read those coordinates and convert them into GRCh37 coordinates, basically here i am converting chromosome region, chromosome start, chromosome stop.
Another class ConvertToGRCh37.java, is developed for taking the GRCh38 coordinates manually by the user, then it will convert them into GRCh37 coordinates

I have tried to achieve the scope of the tool of Ensembl's assembly converter with my code.",2020-06-22T00:23:07Z,billakantiPranayRao
