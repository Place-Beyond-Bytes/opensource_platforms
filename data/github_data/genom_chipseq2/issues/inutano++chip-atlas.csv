MDU6SXNzdWUxNDQwNzcwMjE=,Downloading Data as Separate Bed Files,CLOSED,2016-03-28T20:37:42Z,2016-04-10T17:25:31Z,2016-04-10T17:25:31Z,"Hey Guys,

Neat tool, I really like the web interface and the clear explanation of the pipeline steps. 

I was wondering if it's possible to download all datasets for a category as separate bed files in a compressed folder. For instance, I want to download all TF ChIP peak regions from mouse liver. When using the data browser the default is to combine all peaks into a single bed file which seems...odd. I can probably figure out how to split the file based on track information in column 4, but this seems more complicated than it needs to be.

Let me know if I'm missing some feature.

Thanks,

Bryan

I wanted to use data from your service, but stumbled over a problem when trying to download data for SRX2409974. Trying to understand why, it looks like the alignment failed. At least the alignment rate is 0%. Is this really correct? Or is it simply a processing error? I also do not understand how you can filter out 14% duplicates with 0% aligned reads? This results in 0 peaks. This is an Encode sample and their processing, admittedly different, comes out with ~64k peaks:
https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF169XNB/

If it is a processing error, it might be the case it happened for several samples... Could that be?

Another example is SRX083227 with 0.9% aligned reads, 28% duplicates and 3 peaks.

What do you think?

I wonder if the the helpful user interface you provide  https://chip-atlas.org/peak_browser could be extended so that one can specify a genomic region (for instance hg38 or hg19 chr2:127,015,600-127,181,721) to constrain the query?     This would allow us to obtain a small bed file quickly.

I cant thank you enough for providing such a wonderful resource for everybody. Not only the processing part, data in your website is sometimes easier to search than GEO datasets.

I have couple suggestions for more accurate dataset search.

1) Could you add a search button to dataset search sections? Something results come up as I type also I live in canada so sometimes i dont know if the server is searching on the background or just frozen.
2) Could you maybe add a literal search option. My favorite proteins are AR and ER. But these almost exist in any word.

Tracking it down, there is something odd when I compare the old saved results to the new ones - for any experiment in the chip-atlas dataset, the peak number is much lower - therefore, the overlap with my dataset is also much lower.

For example:

Old dataset:
SRX1161166	TFs and others	NR3C1	Breast	MCF-7	13463	21/758	2/758	-4.23037	-2.43098	10.5

New dataset:
SRX1161166	TFs and others	NR3C1	Breast	MCF-7	1848	0/758	0/758	0	0	inf

13463 peaks for the old dataset for this experiment vs 1848 in the new one - its a massive difference, and the overlaps are also wildly different (21 vs 0, all experiments).

All files follow the same trend with much fewer peaks than before - however, the files in the 'download' section of the website still correspond to the old dataset peak number.

Thank you for developing the ChIP-Atlas.

I'm unable to perform a combined analysis and obtained a list of target genes. 
In particular, I'm looking for all the putative target genes of very unexplored TFs hetero-dimers in the human blood cell lines.

From ChIP-Atlas: Peak Browser I selected all the experimental conditions for the two TF of interest (human genome, ChIP from TFs, blood cell, threshold of 100, and the antigen protein of interest), visualizing the binding with IGV genome browser. Of course, if I select a particular gene I can see if there is a peak in the same position for both proteins. My problem is that I would like to obtain a list of the total genes of the genome with overlapped peaks for both proteins (possibly near the TSS). I tried with the ""combined data track"" tool in the IGV software, but it doesn't allow me to select the tracks. 

How can I perform this type of analysis? I tried also with ChIP-Atlas: Target Genes, selecting the distance of +/-1kb from TSS for both proteins, but I'm unable to obtain a list of genes.

Thank you for your support.

Now for the issue - I have been trying to run a couple of enrichment analyses of bed files and they have been hanging for > 12 hours. The analyses were estimated to take 16-17 mins each. Is there an issue with the server? The Request ID for one of them is 
wabi_chipatlas_2024-1028-1225-33-760-433954.

Thank you so much.",sgourisankar,https://github.com/inutano/chip-atlas/issues/141
