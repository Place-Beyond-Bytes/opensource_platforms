I_kwDOHnk0is5Xp1_G,"Is there any relationship between false positives and ""rescue mapping""?",CLOSED,2022-12-01T03:02:35Z,2023-01-19T09:02:31Z,2023-01-19T09:02:30Z,"Very interesting work, and some nice results in terms of performance and sensitivity! However, the false positive rate is pretty startling--I suspect it is unacceptably high for many applications.

In section 3.6.3 I noticed this concept of ""rescue mapping"" when there is no hit above the user-provided threshold. I was curious: do you see any enrichment for false positives among these rescued reads? You mention that it improves sensitivity, but I am curious what the cost is.",jamestwebber,https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/Genome-on-Diet/issues/1
