- [x] search for all required scripts and binaries in the PATH, remove hard-coded paths
- [ ] install shoot_peng as part of a python package. This will allow to avoid duplication of the command line parser
- [ ] rewrite shoot_peng so that it uses a function `add_arguments(argparse_parser)` which adds arguments to a given parser
- [ ] integrate shoot_peng into the `bamm_wrapper`

My name is Enas and I am a Ph.D. student. My research focuses on static code analysis. I was looking for open-source software to collect some static code analysis tool warnings. I checked your source code, and I ran one of static code analysis tools over the source code. A number of warnings were generated; some of them may represent true defects in the source code and some may represent false reports, where the tool shows a defect but in reality there is none. 

I need your help by going through the warnings and checking if any of them represent a true defect in your source code. To do that, kindly find the attached file, which contains the warnings. 

Your response and help are highly appreciated. 

Thanks, 
Enas
