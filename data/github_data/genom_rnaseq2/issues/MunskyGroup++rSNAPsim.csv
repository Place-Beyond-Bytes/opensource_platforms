I_kwDOCf0H8s6PoqdF,fileparser does not handle multisequence fastas,CLOSED,2024-07-15T23:19:25Z,2024-08-27T19:04:00Z,2024-08-27T19:03:59Z,The file parser does not currently handle multi sequence fastas.

Support for these modifications could be added, however many functions check the length of the sequence so a small function would be needed to convert multicharacter modifications to a single character to work with the code as is.",Will-Raymond,https://github.com/MunskyGroup/rSNAPsim/issues/14
I_kwDOCf0H8s6PzD0B,Update the provided example notebooks,OPEN,2024-07-17T03:01:41Z,2024-07-17T03:01:42Z,,"The current notebooks on the repository are out of date for the newer versions of rSNAPsim and need to be redone.

We need the following notebooks:

* Sequence manipulation
Guides the user through manipulating a sequence and creating a POI object or mRNA object and all its features. Should show them the options such as codon optimization routines.

* Propensity calculation
Show the user how to convert codons to stepping rates for a TASEP or ODE model. Shows various options for calculating these rates as well as how to overwrite or access specific rates.

* Model Solving
Show the user how to solve the various models: ODE, TASEP, custom TASEP and their outputs

* Analyses
Show the user what options there are to do with a solved model such as calculate correlations and ribosomal occupancy

* Model fitting
Provide an example to the user of how to use the rSNAPsim to perform model fitting and selection using the optimization module.

* Experiment Design using rSNAPsim and rSNAPed
Simulate multiple models to differentiate with different experiment types

* FSS model refit
Provide and example of using rSNAPsim from start to beginning to fully fit a model and how the pipeline works

I_kwDOCf0H8s6iVZgt,Function that condenses solution arrays,CLOSED,2024-12-06T16:58:39Z,2024-12-12T23:21:28Z,2024-12-12T23:21:28Z,"SSA solution arrays currently save the particle/agent array in the shape N_traj, N_times, Max_ribs, array size (4 + ncolors + nrxns). Max ribosome count is calculated based on the size of the lattice divided by the particle size. This corresponds to the maximum amount of ribosomes that can occupy a given mRNA, however almost all simulations will never result in a fully collided and occupied mRNA. Hence the agent array is mostly sparse and empty. 

Should there be a function to trim these zeros off? 
Pros: saves memory and saving size 
Cons: separate simulation runs will not concatenate nicely due to stochastic nature of the maximum ribosomes that appeared in a given run. ",Will-Raymond,https://github.com/MunskyGroup/rSNAPsim/issues/28
