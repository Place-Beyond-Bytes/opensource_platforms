MDU6SXNzdWU0NDA0MTczMTY=,The usage of TriPepSVM about  new taxon ids.,OPEN,2019-05-05T08:26:15Z,2019-05-06T10:03:37Z,,"Hello,
I recently used your TriPepSVM to predict RBPs, but the species used included A.thaliana and S.cerevisiae. The  taxon ids  were 3702 and 4932, respectivel through uniprot, but I got errors as follows:
Python: can't open file 'get_rbps_for_taxon.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
Fatal Error:
Failed to open the database file
Program halted !!
Rm: cannot remove ‘non-RBP/A//allData/RBP_3702.fasta.clstr’: No such file or directory

But on human species, it works fine. 

The code I run is as follows:
 ./TriPepSVM.sh -i non-RBP/S.cerevisiae-non-RBP135 -o non-RBP/S/ -id 4932 -pos 1.8 -neg 0.2 -thr 0.68
I don't know where the problem is?

Looking forward to your reply, thank you.

When I gave this command `./TriPepSVM.sh -i humanProteom.fasta -o Results/ -id 9606 -posW 1.8 -negW 0.2 -thr 0.28`
it gives an error` ---- > -posW isn't a valid input argument`

Kindly help.
