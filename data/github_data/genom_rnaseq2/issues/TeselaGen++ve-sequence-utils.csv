The enzymeList.json becomes problematic, since the default webpack settings in Angular CLI cannot resolve json files, by changing the enzymeList to a json object in a js file this could be resolved.

**Suggested change**
enzymeList.json -> enzymeList.js

add `module.exports = ` to the beginning of the file",Scandiravian,https://github.com/TeselaGen/ve-sequence-utils/issues/3

Change: add field **U** in exported object with following fields.

However, I couldn't find any info on _hydrophobicity_ for Selenocysteine 
and I am not familiar with your coloring system

I_kwDOAxFbU847aYmc,`aminoAcidToDegenerateDnaMap.js` is using a RNA map for converting AA sequence to DNA sequence,CLOSED,2021-09-15T07:56:38Z,2021-09-18T01:23:05Z,2021-09-18T01:23:05Z,"Hi @tnrich, 
I found the `Copy DNA BPs` functionality is not working correctly, then I did some dig up, found the `aminoAcidToDegenerateDnaMap.js` file is using a RNA map parsing AA seq to DNA seq. (Should change all `u` to `t`). This is not right, could you fix this ?

Also, the `R` amnio acid should be `mgn`, rather than `mng`, could you also fix this? 

Or may I submit a PR instead ?
