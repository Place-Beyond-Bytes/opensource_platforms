What do you thing about packaging longranger in Conda package by comiting into the [BioConda repository](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes)

MDU6SXNzdWU2Mjc0NzI5MDk=,Longranger alignment statisitcs,OPEN,2020-05-29T18:58:33Z,2020-06-02T15:58:55Z,,"
Dear all,
I am using longranger align for mapping tetraploid plant samples (10x reads) (Potato-tetraploid) on my reference. Overall alignment rate is 95%.
For variant calling i am interested in choosing properly paired end reads and in my case its too low (67.35%).
Why longranger reports low properly paired end reads and whats the mechanism /algorithm behind reporting these reads)? Is there any other better option for aligning 10x linked reads?
Secondly longranger wgs works for tetraploid samples as well? Because I normaly use freebayes separately to call variants across all samples as I have both diploid and tetraploid samples.
