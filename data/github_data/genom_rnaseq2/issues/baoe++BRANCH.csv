I got this error at installation phase,  for almost all functions in main BRANCH.cpp file. some are here:

/tmp/ccJhWoQu.o: In function `print()':
BRANCH.cpp:(.text+0x1210f): multiple definition of `print()'
/tmp/ccuSi8GG.o:BRANCH.cpp:(.text+0x1210f): first defined here
/tmp/ccJhWoQu.o: In function `main':
BRANCH.cpp:(.text+0x1232a): multiple definition of `main'
/tmp/ccuSi8GG.o:BRANCH.cpp:(.text+0x1232a): first defined here
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

Is it something I am doing wrong while compilation or somthing is missing in BRANCH master code?


Best,
