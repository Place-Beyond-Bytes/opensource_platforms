* Filters HMMER alignments using optimal E-value thresholds determined
  through a validation study. (issue-7)
* Includes prepackaged pHMMs for whole HIV genome. (issue-8)
* Re-implemented the main hivmmer script in python and added support for
  whole-genome alignment and additional reporting output. (issue-9)
* Improves the consistency of whole-genome coverage by passing all translated
  sequences to HMMER, and removing alignments with stop codons after alignment.
  This approach retains reads that span one or more genes in different frames,
  which were dropped in the previous approach since they would have stop codons
  in the region of the read lying in the other frame. (issue-10)",2020-02-21T03:15:06Z,mhowison

* Added an output file listing the frequency of specific insertion codons at
  each site (issue-1).
* Replaced the fastx_collapser stage with a new QC filtering stage that
  implements a read length filter (>75) and mean PHRED score filter (>25), and
  performs deduplication like fastx_collapser (issue-6).",2019-08-23T23:12:44Z,mhowison
