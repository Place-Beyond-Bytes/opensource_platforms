MDU6SXNzdWU2ODY3NjIyMA==,5'_to_3'_RNA_Molecule OWL class,OPEN,2015-04-15T13:00:12Z,2015-04-15T13:00:12Z,,"```
I would like to ask which class in the OWL ontology corresponds to the 
5'_to_3'_RNA_Molecule entity that is formalised in the paper? The OWL classes 
are encoded in the format ""RNA0_ ""+7-digit number.

Thanks,
Despoina

MDU6SXNzdWU0Mzk4ODc0OTg=,Unescaped quotes in `rnao.obo`,OPEN,2019-05-03T05:00:32Z,2019-05-03T05:02:06Z,,"Hi !

Following the [discussion about the status of the RNAO project](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/867) we figured out it would be a good idea to report the possible errors in RNAO files.

`rnao.obo` contains several unescaped quotes in quoted strings, such as:
```ini
def: ""A family_11_base_pair is an RNAO_base_pair in which two RNA nucleotides interact by edge-to-edge hydrogen-bonding between the Sugar edges of each base and in which the glycosidic bonds of the two nucleotides are oriented ""cis"" relative to each other."" [RNAO:ROC]
```

The offenders:
* `""cis""`
* `""trans""`
* `""hairpin loop""` ",althonos,https://github.com/BGSU-RNA/rnao/issues/2

The URL used to access the RO uses a direct link to the obofoundry (`http://www.obofoundry.org/ro/ro.owl`), which results in a 404 error when trying to reach it. The new obolibrary PURL should be used instead (`http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ro.owl`).",althonos,https://github.com/BGSU-RNA/rnao/issues/3

`rnao.owl` contains multiple occurrences of tags that should be unique:
* in `RNAO:1000308`, multiple `rdfs:comment`
* in `RNAO:0000000`, multiple `rdfs:comment`
* in `RNAO:0000059`, multiple `rdfs:label`

This causes ROBOT to fail when it tries to load the `rnao.owl` product.",althonos,https://github.com/BGSU-RNA/rnao/issues/4
MDU6SXNzdWU0Mzk4OTE0OTE=,Typedefs imported from RO should be refered to using xrefs,OPEN,2019-05-03T05:22:45Z,2019-05-03T05:22:45Z,,"Hi!

The OBO semantics describes the following procedure to use local names for RO (and BFO) relationships:
1. Declare a local typedef with an unprefixed ID
2. Add an xref to the actual RO typedef

So for instance the following frame from `rnao.obo`:
```ini
[Typedef]
id: ro.owl#has_quality
name: has quality
```
should instead be declared
```ini
[Typedef]
id: has_quality
xref: RO:has_quality
```

See the OBO semantics section [5.9.3](http://owlcollab.github.io/oboformat/doc/obo-syntax.html#5.9.3) and [8.2.2](http://owlcollab.github.io/oboformat/doc/obo-syntax.html#8.2.2) for more information about this mechanism.",althonos,https://github.com/BGSU-RNA/rnao/issues/5
