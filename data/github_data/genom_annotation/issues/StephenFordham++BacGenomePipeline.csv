MDU6SXNzdWU4MjMwOTA0NDk=,how to assemble genomes with four fasta files?,CLOSED,2021-03-05T13:33:11Z,2021-03-05T19:44:37Z,2021-03-05T19:44:37Z,"HI @StephenFordham 
Very nice toolbox. Could I ask one question about the input for the genome assembly? Here, for one strain, we have four fasta files? Could we still use your nice toolbox?
