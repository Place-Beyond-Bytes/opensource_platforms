1. **taxonID - gbif id, use ""GBIF<taxonID>"" as alt_taxon_id if no NCBI match/synonym found**
2. datasetID - ignore for now for GenomeHubs
3. **parentNameUsageID - parent taxon id to establish parent-child links**; An identifier for the name usage of the direct, most proximate higher-rank parent taxon (in a classification) of the most specific element of the scientificName
4. **acceptedNameUsageID - Use to establish synonyms**; An identifier for the name usage of the currently valid (zoological) or accepted (botanical) taxon.
5. **originalNameUsageID - Use this to establish synonyms**; An identifier for the name usage in which the terminal element of the scientificName was originally established under the rules of the associated nomenclaturalCode
6. scientificName - use to manually resolve conflicts; The full scientific name, with authorship and date information if known
7. scientificNameAuthorship - use to manually resolve conflicts; The authorship information for the scientificName formatted according to the conventions of the applicable nomenclaturalCode
8. **canonicalName - Use this for comparing to NCBI names/synonyms** . The canonical form of the name. This form has no authorship or more than 3 name parts. 
9. genericName - Ignore for now for GenomeHubs
10. specificEpithet - Ignore for now for GenomeHubs; The name of the first or species epithet of the scientificName.
11. infraspecificEpithet - Ignore for now for GenomeHubs; The name of the lowest or terminal infraspecific epithet of the scientificName, excluding any rank designation
12. **taxonRank**
13. nameAccordingTo - Ignore for now for GenomeHubs; The reference to the source in which the specific taxon concept circumscription is defined or implied - traditionally signified by the Latin ""sensu"" or ""sec."" (from secundum, meaning ""according to""). For taxa that result from identifications, a reference to the keys, monographs, experts and other sources should be given.
14. namePublishedIn - Ignore for now for GenomeHubs; A reference for the publication in which the scientificName was originally established under the rules of the associated nomenclaturalCode.
15. **taxonomicStatus**
16. nomenclaturalStatus
17. taxonRemarks
18. **kingdom**
19. **phylum**
20. **class**
21. **order**
22. **family**
23. **genus**

In an ideal world the only thing for an attribute in a FILE yaml would be things specific to the file such as
```
header: 
separator: 
```
but when I run it this way, it gives me a 'type' error.

Example:
```

```
So I put type: in the FILE*yaml too:
```
header: 
separator: 
type: 
```
and now it runs fine.

Am guessing that’s not by design because I think type should be set once per attribute.

All good. Returns what I think it the URL should return as well:

But! It does not return the TSV I expect.

Try:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' ""https://goat.genomehubs.org/api/v2/report?result=taxon&includeEstimates=false&summaryValues=count&taxonomy=ncbi&report=table&y=gc_percent&rank=species&x=tax_tree%28lamiales%29%20and%20assembly_span"" -H ""accept: text/tab-separated-values""

JSON looks good to me though:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' ""https://goat.genomehubs.org/api/v2/report?result=taxon&includeEstimates=false&summaryValues=count&taxonomy=ncbi&report=table&y=gc_percent&rank=species&x=tax_tree%28lamiales%29%20and%20assembly_span"" -H ""accept: application/json""

I could implement something my side to parse the JSON but I presume this will want to be fixed for future?

They would like to display bars for each taxon side by side, instead of having the taxon names as categories.

I was not able to get there with available types of reports.
- The best I came up with then was to generate [2 histograms side by side](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fEZAnvzAWA8jcHkTT5uTsSkKXQ7wrj941npGKYpRuQU/edit) to compare the data.

**Is it possible to create a single report to compare across a taxonomic level?** 
-how many out of a projects target list have reach a specific status?

In my head it would work somewhat like:
- pick a tax_tree (e.g. Chiroptera)
- set the xField to a particular category like tax_rank (e.g. Families - in the case of Chiroptera will have around 20 bins)
- set the max Y as the count of one attribute (e.g. long_list=dtol and tax_rank(species)
- set the real Y as the nested attribute (e.g. sample_acquired=dtol and tax_rank(species))
- (these last 2 would appear as a xInY report, but displayed as a single bar

Some suggestions: from the users also included:
- an arc report that would report xPerTaxon instead of xPerRank
- The total would be normalised to % to allow a rainbow plot regardless of total",ccaio,https://github.com/genomehubs/genomehubs/issues/312

There is a text tab separated file you could use for this function:

This file continuously updates as new assemblies are added to this system.
Pick up the file periodically to create these outlinks.

Using the first column, the GCx (x == [AF]) accession name, an out link to the UCSC
