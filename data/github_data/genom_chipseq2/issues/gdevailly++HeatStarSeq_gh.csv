MDU6SXNzdWUxNjYwNjM4OTc=,Highlight group of genes in HeatRNAseq,OPEN,2016-07-18T10:29:22Z,2016-07-18T10:29:22Z,,"""Hi Guillaume,

I have been using Heatseq and like it very much. I like the pairwise correlation plot function for analysis RNA, but I thought it would be very useful to be able to highlight groups of genes on the plot. For example if you could plot the expression of genes in brain vs the whole organism and then highlight genes that are bound by a transcription factor so that those genes appear in a different colour on the plot. Do you have any plans to add such functionality?

Cheers,
Seth Cheetham""

MDU6SXNzdWUxNjYwNjc1MDU=,Extract expression value for a gene,OPEN,2016-07-18T10:53:07Z,2016-07-18T10:53:07Z,,"""Dear Guillaume, 

Is it possible to draw a correlation of two genes in the entire dataset.
For eg: If i have two genes, for eg: PTEN and TP53, i want correlation value/plot across all RNA-seq data.  Will it be possible to get a matrix table/pdf file, by simply putting the genes name, and extract the computed values. 
In my opinion, having such options might be very useful for users.

Thank you !!
with regards
Chirag Nepal""
