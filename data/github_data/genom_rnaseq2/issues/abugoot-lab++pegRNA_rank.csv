I_kwDOF-i0gc55ghVn, Unable to Operate the Program with a 4.9k Insertion,OPEN,2023-12-12T21:21:57Z,2023-12-12T21:21:57Z,,"Hi,

I am trying to use this program to sequence atgRNA for a 4.9k insertion. But after I put the whole sequence in the command window. The program is frozen (I think it is just running forever and I did not see the question pop out). When I try to run with some short sequence (just random sequences ~500 bp it works fine). I am kind of confused since I saw you used cargo with 4906 bp so I am not sure why mine is not working. Did I do anything wrong? Thank you very much!

Sincerely,

Ling",LingShi010,https://github.com/abugoot-lab/pegRNA_rank/issues/2
