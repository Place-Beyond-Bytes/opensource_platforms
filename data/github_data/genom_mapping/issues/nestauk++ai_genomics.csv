We are looking for a mixture of people, but especially those who:

* Understand and work on genomic science, and particularly the application of AI to genomics;
* Understand and have insight into the larger trends in private and public funding for genomics research and R&D; or
* Understand and have insight into the larger trends in terms of how government, industry and other actors are thinking about researching and deploying genomic science.
 

I was wondering if it would be possible to use the data so far generated by the scientometric analysis to help identify relevant figures.

Specifically, is it possible to look through the data

* To identify people who match or look likely to match the above criteria; and/or
