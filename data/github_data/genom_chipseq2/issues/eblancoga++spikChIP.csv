I've looked to the table ""results/1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16_SPIKCHIP_10000_spike-sample_avg_names.txt"" and it is empty. 
Can you help me with this error? Thanks!

Thank you for this nice tool, I recently tested it on some Chip-RX data from my lab.
I would like to ask for your help about a couple of issues  I faced.

Among the output files,  I get the **1000_avg_normalized_sample** only for the SPIKCHIP method. I converted this file to bedGraph and then to bigwig. However, I would like to create a bigwig also for the other normalization methods in order to compare them. How could I achieve this?

Moreover, when  I open in igv the output bigwigs files, for two samples of the same histone modification I get a high signal in the background regions that is also constant. I am struggling to understand what is happening. 

See here:

Sample 1 and 3 are from the same histone modification (H3K27Me3), whereas 2 and 4 are from H2Ak119ub1

Hope you can help me out.
Thanks!

I_kwDOFYT5ns54sk1d,Bin size,CLOSED,2023-12-04T23:01:18Z,2023-12-28T11:00:17Z,2023-12-28T11:00:17Z,"Hi,

First of all, thank you for making this software.

I would like to use a bin size of 20 bp (or 50bp), because I would like higher ChIP-seq signal resolution.
Qn 1: Would I lose reliability of normalisation if I use bin sizes this small?

You mention ""selection of this [1000 bp] was based on finding a balance between ChIP-seq resolution, and the computational memory demand and running time required for a more compact bin segmentation"".
Qn 2: Could I get an idea of how memory demand and run time scales for smaller bin sizes please?

Thank you,

Thank you for developing such a useful tool. I'm currently attempting to use spikChIP with human cell line samples and have encountered an error while running the R script (avg.R). The error message is:

```
mn <- normalize.loess(m,subset=s)
Error in simpleLoess(y, x, w, span, degree = degree, parametric = parametric,  : 
  NA/NaN/Inf in foreign function call (arg 1)
In addition: There were 44 warnings (use warnings() to see them)
```
All values within the script are greater than 0.1, and there are no NAs, at least.
