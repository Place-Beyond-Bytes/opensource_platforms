MDU6SXNzdWU0MDM3NTM3OQ==,Rtax assignment issue,OPEN,2014-08-15T19:09:58Z,2014-08-15T19:09:58Z,,"Hello,
I run into an odd issue while assigning taxonomy to my OTU table, I was hoping you could help me out with this.
These two assignments dont really make sense to me:

144065  0.0     1.0 None
592589  1.0     0.0 NOHIT

However, in the reference taxonomy file these OTU's have hits...
144065  k__Bacteria; p__Proteobacteria; c__Alphaproteobacteria; o__Rhodospirillales; f__Acetobacteraceae; g__; s__
592589  k__Bacteria; p__Proteobacteria; c__Alphaproteobacteria; o__Rhizobiales; f__Rhizobiaceae; g__; s__

So, what does the None and NOHIT mean? When I plot my taxonomy summaries, these categories are generated:
None;Other
NOHIT;Other

Database used: Greengenes
Version:gg_13_5

as you might hopefully know rtax has been packaged for Debian.  If you would use tags to mark the release versions we could easily detect new versions and stay in sync with your development.
Kind regards, Andreas.",tillea,https://github.com/davidsoergel/rtax/issues/2

.TH ""rtax"" 1 ""27 Nov 2014""
.SH ""NAME""
rtax - Rapid and accurate taxonomic classification of short paired-end sequence reads from the 16S ribosomal RNA gene
.SH ""SYNOPSIS""
.B  rtax 
[\fIOPTION\fR]... 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 13
.I \-r refd 
reference database in FASTA format
.TP 13
.I \-t taxonomy
taxonomy file with sequence IDs matching the reference database
.TP 13
.I \-a  queryA 
FASTA file containing query sequences (single-ended or read 1)
.TP 13
.I \-b  queryB
FASTA file containing query sequences (read b, with matching IDs)
.TP 13
.I \-x  
Reverse-complement query A sequences (required if they are provided in the reverse sense)
.TP 13
.I \-y  
Reverse-complement query B sequences (required if they are provided in the reverse sense)
.TP 13
.I \-i  regex
regular expression used to select part of the fasta header to use as the sequence id.  Default: ""(\\S+)""
.TP 13
.I \-l  file
text file containing sequence IDs to process, one per line
.TP 13
.I \-d  delimiter
delimiter separating the two reads when provided in a single file
.TP 13
.I \-m  tempdir
temporary directory.  Will be removed on successful completion, but likely not if there is an error
.TP 13
.I \-f  
for sequences where only one read is available, fall back to single-ended classification.  Default: drop these sequences
.TP 13
.I \-g
for sequences where one read is overly generic, do not fall back to single-ended classification.  Default: classify these sequences based on only the more specific read
.TP 13
.I \-o  classifications.out
output path
