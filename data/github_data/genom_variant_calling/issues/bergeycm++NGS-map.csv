MDU6SXNzdWUyMzgzODcyODU=,well-travelled script: vcf_tab_to_fasta_alignment.pl,CLOSED,2017-06-25T15:27:12Z,2020-09-09T21:19:01Z,2020-09-09T21:19:01Z,"Hi Christina,

I think since you published this script 2012 time, it has travelled quite a bit  ... I found it copied into a copy of vcftools lying around our lab in Scotland here.

What happens in these occasions is that small ad-hoc edits are made, sometimes in a rush, and the output may be different to what you as author intended. For such situations, and dspite it being a small script as you call it, it could benefit from more inline documentation so that people will edit more wisely, and less in a rush.

So this isn't a bug or an issue as such, rather a heads-up that your script is actually pretty famous, and it may be an idea to look at the old version posted on google code and to include a link to the latest version (which I assume is in this repository) and to advise users to update.

I'll fork it and include my own notes for good measure.

Cheers / Ramon.",rafalcode,https://github.com/bergeycm/NGS-map/issues/2
