Much appreciated for your excellent work.
I try to run your code in my project with pangenome command. 
I met a error as following:

So can I use your code in my project? Because I check the command and find you have difined the accs as following:
 accs = [""An-1"",""C24"",""Col"",""Cvi"",""Eri"",""Kyo"",""Ler"",""Sha""].
I think this is only for your project.

I'm trying to compare the degree of genomic rearrangements among a reference genome P and several related query genomes C1-C3. I don't fully understand the files used in step1 (pairwise whole genome alignment and synteny identification) you've described. Are these files included in the folder pairwiseWGA the delta files generated by MUMmer4? or some other files?
Also, I just want to make comparisons between the genoem P and each query genome C, escaping the pairwise comparisons within query genomes, so is it OK to use your scripts? Or, do I need to modify some command lines in the scripts?
Looking forward for your reply!

I_kwDODBV7Ws5Bex0v,Synteny diversity calculation?,OPEN,2022-01-11T02:40:28Z,2022-01-11T06:48:34Z,,"Hi Wen-Biao,

Thanks for providing the code for your recent publication. Good work on this.

I just have a query about the calculation of synteny diversity.

In the publication, it is defined as:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13409610/148715410-1079d1ed-ccf7-4c69-85e6-a38ab9b64603.png)

It looks like the script 'calculate.syn.diversity.pl' takes all pairwise comparisons and sums the number of times a site is non-synonymous then divides this sum by the total number of comparisons. Is this correct?

If i and j from the equation refer to all pairwise comparisons and pi_ij is either a 1 or a 0, or  the fraction of 1s over all possible pairwise comparisons, this is not quite the same as what the script actually does. 

For example, working with 11 genomes, we would have 55 pairwise comparisons. Let's say 20/55 comparisons evaluate to 1 as the sites are syntenic. The fraction of syntenic comparisons would be 20/55. This seems to be the number that 'calculate.syn.diversity.pl' gives us. However, this is not what one would get using the algebra in the equation.

For example:
`Pi=0`
`for(i in 1:10){for(j in (i+1):11){Pi=Pi+1/11*(1/11)*(20/55)}}`

Would set Pi to about 0.17, whereas 20/55 is actually 0.36. If you keep 20/55 as the fraction of non-syntenic sites among all pairwise comparisons then perform the same analysis for all isolates including self-comparisons, for example:

`Pi=0`
`for(i in 1:11){for(j in 1:11){Pi=Pi+1/11*(1/11)*(20/55)}}`

Then Pi will be set to 0.36, which is the same as just outputting 20/55. Is this what the equation is describing? If so, one could omit the summation of x_ij and just say that this statistic is the fraction of non-syntenic sites among all pairwise comparisons. It would be a lot simpler.

Please can you provide a few more details on synteny diversity and how calculate.syn.diversity.pl works? Is my interpretation of this script correct?
