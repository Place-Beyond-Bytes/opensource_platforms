I_kwDOA7SEeM5U4C7Z,missing predecessor arrows?,OPEN,2022-10-26T12:57:45Z,2022-10-26T14:28:37Z,,"Hi Freiburg team,

I love your alignment resources for teaching! Thanks for this great service.

When I am using Gotoh and click one an arbitrary cell in one of the three DP matrices, I assume that the outgoing arrows indicate the predecessor cells. If that is the case, shouldn""t there be two arrows in every P-entry / Q-entry and three for every D-entry? On my browser (tested Firefox and Chrome) under Ubunutu 20.4, I can only spot n-1.

Unfortunately, I cannot attach a screenshot through this form. Let""s see if I can send it to you via mail.

Best,
Stefan
