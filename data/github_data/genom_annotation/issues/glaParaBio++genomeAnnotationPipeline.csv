Thanks for putting this together.
I'm following your example to do a test run, with one of my own genomes. I got the following error:

```
mamba activate genomeAnnotationPipeline

OUT_DIR=""/home/gnii0001/07_dsm/result/euk_annotation""
cd /home/gnii0001/tools/genomeAnnotationPipeline

snakemake -p -n -j 20 \
    --config sample_sheet=/home/gnii0001/07_dsm/074_merged/script/metadata/sample_sheet.txt \
             genemark_tar_gz=/home/gnii0001/tools/gmes/gmes_linux_64_4.tar.gz \
    -d $OUT_DIR

```

I think I'm not fully understanding how the `sample_sheet.txt` file should be formatted. In my case, I have the genomic sequence, and species name being `Ophryoscolex caudatus`, and I don't have a reference proteome. Could you suggest how to proceed?

Many thanks!

Ps. previously I filled reference_proteome as NA, but it ran into the following issue, and therefore I used `""""` to circumvent that.
