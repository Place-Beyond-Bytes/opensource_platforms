At the moment, these variants are reported in tables that are stratified.

Expected behavior: Define the reference genome per callset and consequently use the correct `rename-contigs` contigs file (grch37_ucsc2ensembl or grch38_ucsc2ensembl).

Current behavior: For specific callsets `grch37: true` can be defined but setting `grch37: false` per callset does not work. The file for rename contigs has to be set manually.",famosab,https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/dna-seq-benchmark/issues/99
