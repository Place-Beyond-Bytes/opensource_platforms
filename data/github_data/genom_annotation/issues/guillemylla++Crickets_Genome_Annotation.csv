I_kwDODnzFQM5Ewkik,Python script not found,OPEN,2022-02-28T03:34:07Z,2022-02-28T11:07:58Z,,"Hello,

I am having issues running your analysis steps.
When running Analysis (~/CpGoe/1_Count_CpGoe.ipynb), you used part of a python script (~/dn_ds/Dn_Ds_CodeML.ipynb) to extract the longest CDS per gene, so I looked for it.
However, I could not find that python script.

Perhaps it is because the version of the directory is newer.

Where can I find the original python script?

Thank you.
