when I export a subset with

I found that savvy updated the INFO/AF which is a great feature. However, the INFO/MAF remained unchanged.

You have some re-direct scheme in place. Is there another destination that people should use instead of the above? Also, how were users supposed to reach this through a proxy? No system config for proxy is honored during these attempts.

MDU6SXNzdWU4MzY0MTczNDY=,Understanding sav benefits.,OPEN,2021-03-19T22:24:11Z,2021-03-24T20:23:49Z,,"I'm trying to catch up on what's been going on in the world of alternat vcf representations and I'm trying to understand what the benefits of savvy are vs bcf.  I've run into a few questions.

1.  It seems like the big difference is the addition of a sparse vector type.  The random vcf files I've tried *savving* haven't seen any appreciable size improvement from running `sav import` on them though so I was wondering if you had some examples of files that benefited from using savvy.     I suspect I'm either using files that don't particularly benefit from the sparsity reduction, or I've misconfigured my import.

2. I don't understand how PBWT is used by sav files and what benefit that gives.  Does it only apply to genotype fields?  I tried looking in the code, but I couldn't find where it actually computes PBWT.  It seems like it's just tagging fields as being PBWT sorted?  Is this passing through something processed upstream and just acting as a marker for it?  How is this intended to be used? I'm not really a C++ programmer so I may have just missed something obvious.

3. From what I can tell sav doesn't directly address the problem of encoding gvcf files efficiently.  (Although they could probably benefit from the sparse vector type when encoding sparse PLs.).  Is that outside of the mandate of the sav format? 

Thank you.   Let me know if there's a better forum for asking general non-code questions about savvy.",lbergelson,https://github.com/statgen/savvy/issues/11

Would it be possible to provide a standalone version of the `sav` utility as a download ?

This would simplify the ""installation"" and allow users to try the utility by simple download instead of installing from (ana)conda or building from source. (E.g., as a standalone binary for GNU/Linux).

Thank you.

What would be a good starting point as for values for the parameters listed in the ""Parameter Trade-offs"" section of the README ?

If I would compress GT data with `sav` would the following command seem acceptable ?
```
sav import --phasing full --pbwt-field ""GT"" <input> <output>
```
Or do I need to specify a block size for it to work effectively ?

Could you share settings which gave a nice balance between size and speed ? (I understand this is dataset dependent but e.g., as used on TOPMed) Or do you have any general recommandations ?

Thanks !

```

```
20      60810   rs527408846     G       GA      100     PASS    .       GT      0       1       0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0
```

The last sample is now haploid instead of diploid on that variant loci, an allele is lost (`0|0` becomes `0`).

I_kwDOA8j8d85EHH5k,Sample extraction fails with -O bcf,OPEN,2022-02-18T09:31:04Z,2022-02-18T14:58:47Z,,"Hello.
I compressed chr1 from 1KGP3 (available here ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/)

And checked the file with the following commands : 
```bash
sav export -O vcf chr1.sav | less
```
```bash
sav export -O bcf chr1.sav | bcftools view | less
```
This is ok.

Then, for sample extraction and ran the following commands : 
```bash
sav export -O vcf -i ""NA12878,HG00109"" chr1.sav | less
```
which works but,

```bash
sav export -O bcf -i ""NA12878,HG00109"" chr1.sav | bcftools view | less
```
doesn't work, only the header is shown.


So it seems there is a small bug with the interaction of the `-O bcf` and `-i ""sample list""` options.

I_kwDOA8j8d85Gv_oG,Build failure on arm64: Templates not found because char is unsigned,CLOSED,2022-03-30T21:01:38Z,2022-05-16T16:43:08Z,2022-05-16T16:43:07Z,"Savvy can't build or run on arm64 right now, because char is unsigned on arm64 and this code assumes that char will be signed. The C/C++ specification says nothing about the signed-ness of char by default, so if char is signed varies by compiler / architecture / implementation.

Edit about my specific environment: I'm on an Apple Silicon M1 Mac, building this both on mac OS and also Ubuntu on arm64 inside of Docker. Our intent is to evaluate the Graviton AWS instances, which would need tooling to work and perform well on arm64.

Some quick ways to work around this would be to either specify that these types are signed chars, or to update the template so that it works on unsigned types. I haven't investigated deeper and barely know C++, so I'd appreciate your help with a solution.

Specifically, I see that typed_value.hpp we have some char vectors https://github.com/statgen/savvy/blob/master/include/savvy/typed_value.hpp#L1712
```
    std::vector<char> off_data_;
    std::vector<char> val_data_;
```
and then expect to be able to operate on them with this template https://github.com/statgen/savvy/blob/master/include/savvy/typed_value.hpp#L125:

```
    template<typename T>
    static typename std::enable_if<std::is_signed<T>::value, std::uint8_t>::type

I figured out why I can't build savvy locally: When I run `cget build` or `cget install`, it is trying to get xz, which is a dependency of shrinkwrap. Is there any way that xz could use the github mirror instead, so that at least savvy, shrinkwrap, xz, and other deps could all be coming from the same service with fewer points of failure?

When cget is trying to build XZ, it's getting back this and trying to build it as a package:

It looks like in some environments, to use `<cinttypes>`, then `__STDC_FORMAT_MACROS` must be defined. I've seen this across a few projects. I don't see anywhere where this is defined in savvy. I do not encounter this problem when I'm building savvy by itself using `cget build`, which makes me think that there may be some configuration set somewhere I cannot find. My build environment is a bone standard Ubuntu 20.04 on a plain Intel Xeon CPU.

This could be solved by either #defining `__STDC_FORMAT_MACROS` above where `<cinttypes>` is included in the source files, or setting the config globally with add_definitions(-D__STDC_FORMAT_MACROS) in CMakeLists.txt. I'm working on a minimal reproduction of this to see if I can understand why it's working sometimes but not others.

Unfortunately, I cannot share the data files, but one very visible observation that we had in regard to Savvy, was, that between 75k samples and 100k samples there is a huge jump in file size; it more than doubles. After that the file size of Savvy always seems to be very close ot BCF.

It looks like savvy fails to build on 22.04, I first saw this reported here: https://github.com/saigegit/SAIGE/issues/44, then reproduced it by failing to build savvy standalone.

At a quick glance, it looks like savvy is using std::numeric_limits without `#include <limits>` [all](https://github.com/statgen/savvy/blob/e980ae6da1fb1da99fd26f444e8fab6ae40ea902/src/savvy/sav_reader.cpp#L45) [over](https://github.com/statgen/savvy/blob/3842f47ec4ea1328c1963512bfe2e32412bfcfc1/include/savvy/typed_value.hpp#L162) [the](https://github.com/statgen/savvy/blob/d4bd182f04c8c51c1d98ee9809acdb125bf1c908/include/savvy/reader.hpp#L61) [place](https://github.com/statgen/savvy/blob/e980ae6da1fb1da99fd26f444e8fab6ae40ea902/include/savvy/sav_reader.hpp#L65), which could have only worked by getting lucky with transitive `#include`s. This is a pretty easy fix though, files that are using std::numeric_limits just need to #include limits.

The build failure is a whole lot of this:

One potential way to tackle this is to use a tool like https://github.com/include-what-you-use/include-what-you-use to audit the code and find missing imports. It's available on Debian, Ubuntu, and Homebrew package managers too.
