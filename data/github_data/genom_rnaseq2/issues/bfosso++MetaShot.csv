For the reference collections download, there doesn't seem to be a direct file path, which means it can't be downloaded using wget.  The ""direct link"" is just https://recascloud.ba.infn.it/index.php/s/9dFFTJUr0bOU2mN/download, which isn't the file itself.

Is there a direct path?",transcript,https://github.com/bfosso/MetaShot/issues/6

I'm assuming it is because there are no tango related files (folders)
'Virus/tango_dmp_folder/'
'Bacteria/tango_dmp_folder/',
'Fungi/tango_dmp_folder/' ,
'Protist/tango_dmp_folder/'

Am I supposed to run tango.pl in 'New_TANGO_perl_version' folder? 
If it is, can give some command lines for guidance or perhaps the preprocessed files you used?

Thanks a lot.",withJack,https://github.com/bfosso/MetaShot/issues/11
