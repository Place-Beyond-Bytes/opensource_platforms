I was wondering if you plan to include other models or a code for building the necessary IPA reference?

I would like to ask the author about the input files being limited to the BAM format, I am using two public datasets from GEO (GSE131179 and GSE120649) and both of them can only be fulfilled by converting from SRA format to BAM format, but both of them give me an error when I run them, prompting me to make sure that I am typing in the correct BAM or SAM format file!

Also regarding the test file you mentioned, I downloaded it and found that it is also an SRA file, do I also have to convert it to BAM to run it further?

Thanks a lot！

I really would like to use your software on one of the datasets. Can it run on MacOS? I installed it successfully, but when I call InPACT -h
the error 'getopt illegal option --o' kept popping up. I tried to remove -o from the 'InPACT' script, but now I get another error:
error: argument --annotation_file: expected one argument 
although I'm sure that I put only one argument after -a in InPACT call.

Any suggestions?

I have a question regarding the output format mentioned in the README. You stated that the final output format consists of six columns: Terminal exon, IPA type, Gene, Upstream coordinate, PolyAsite, and IPA usage. Does this refer to the ipa_usage.txt file? The headers in the ipa_usage.txt file is slightly different (region, annotation, gene_id, possible_five_ss, polyA_site, Usage). Do these headers correspond to the columns mentioned in the README?
Additionally, in the ipa_usage.txt file, what does the information in the possible_five_ss column represent? Specifically, what does the number at the end of the entry (e.g., chr1:109214128:+:18) indicate? For instance, in chr1:109214128:+:18, what does the number 18 signify?

I executed the following command:

""InPACT -i sample.bam -a hg38.109.20211119.ncbiRefSeq.gtf -s InPACT_polyAsites.hg38.saf -P 5""
This produced the file 1.predicted.terminal.results.txt in the output folder.

Is this the only output that I should expect?

Additionally, I attempted to run the following command, but it didn’t generate any final output:

""InPACT_transcript --predict_terminal 1.predicted.terminal.results.txt --annotated_gtf hg38.109.20211119.ncbiRefSeq.gtf --fa_path GRCh38.d1.vd1.fa --save_gtf merged.gtf""
Could the issue be related to the FASTA file? What is the correct FASTA file that I should be using?

Thanks!",ShirAmit96,https://github.com/YY-TMU/InPACT/issues/10
