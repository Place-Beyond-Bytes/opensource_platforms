1. a file-based biounit vector (enabling keeping the genome sequence on disk rather than reading the entire thing into memory?

[PackageEvaluator.jl](https://github.com/IainNZ/PackageEvaluator.jl) is a script that runs nightly. It attempts to load all Julia packages and run their test (if available) on both the stable version of Julia (0.2) and the nightly build of the unstable version (0.3).

The results of this script are used to generate a [package listing](http://iainnz.github.io/packages.julialang.org/) enhanced with testing results.

The status of this package, BioSeq, on...
- Julia 0.2 is **'Tests fail, but package loads.'** [![PackageEvaluator.jl](http://iainnz.github.io/packages.julialang.org/badges/full_fail.svg)](http://iainnz.github.io/packages.julialang.org/?pkg=BioSeq&ver=0.2)

_'No tests, but package loads.'_ can be due to their being no tests (you should write some if you can!) but can also be due to PackageEvaluator not being able to find your tests. Consider adding a [`test/runtests.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/6191) file.

_'Package doesn't load.'_ is the worst-case scenario. Sometimes this arises because your package doesn't have BinDeps support, or needs something that can't be installed with BinDeps. If this is the case for your package, please [file an issue](https://github.com/IainNZ/PackageEvaluator.jl) and an exception can be made so your package will not be tested.

**This automatically filed issue is a one-off message. Starting soon, issues will only be filed when the testing status of your package changes in a negative direction (gets worse). If you'd like to opt-out of these status-change messages, reply to this message.**

#### On Julia 0.4
- On **2014-09-28** the testing status was `Tests pass.`
- On **2014-09-29** the testing status changed to `Package doesn't load.`

`Tests pass.` means that PackageEvaluator found the tests for your package, executed them, and they all passed.

`Package doesn't load.` means that PackageEvaluator did not find tests for your package. Additionally, trying to load your package with `using` failed.

This error on Julia 0.4 is possibly due to recently merged pull request https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/8420.
_This issue was filed because your testing status became worse. No additional issues will be filed if your package remains in this state, and no issue will be filed if it improves.

If you'd like to discuss [PackageEvaluator.jl](https://github.com/IainNZ/PackageEvaluator.jl) please file an issue at the repository.

It attempts to load all Julia packages and run their tests (if available) on both the stable
version of Julia (0.3) and the nightly build of the unstable version (0.4).
The results of this script are used to generate a [package listing](http://pkg.julialang.org/)
enhanced with testing results. This service also benefits package developers by notifying them if
their package breaks for some reason (caused by e.g. changes in Julia, changes in dependencies,
or broken binary dependencies.)

Currently PackageEvaluator attempts to find your test scripts using a heuristic, preferring the
standarized `test/runtests.jl` whenever present. Using `test/runtests.jl` allows people to test
your package using simply `Pkg.test(""BioSeq"")`, with any testing-only dependencies being
installed by looking at `test/REQUIRE`.

Your package doesn't appear to have a `test/runtests.jl` file. PackageEvaluator is going to move
away from auto-detecting tests and will instead only test packages with a `test/runtests.jl`
file. This change will take place in about a month.

_You can:_
- **Add the file and tag a new version**. You may in fact have already added this file but not
  tagged a new version. PackageEvaluator only tests your latest tagged verison, so you must tag
  for the file to be detected.
- **Chose to do nothing**. PackageEvaluator will stop attempting to test your package, and the testing
  status will be reported as ""not possible"".
