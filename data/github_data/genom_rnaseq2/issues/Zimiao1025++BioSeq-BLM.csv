How do you insert labels for a sequence in online server?

I am performing residue level analyses, but I am encoutering some problems

FASTA format data : 
>Sequence[9] | Label[1]
VEKAVESGDKKPLRTWSRRST
>Sequence[11] | Label[1]
ILRNRIAGLGKNRKTAVFPKL
>Sequence[453] | Label[-1]
SEIKRDAEELKRLGAELVDLG
>Sequence[455] | Label[-1]
