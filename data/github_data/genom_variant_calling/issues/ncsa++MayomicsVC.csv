MDU6SXNzdWU0NDg0Njg2ODA=,Increasing number of cores for running GATK4 tools.,OPEN,2019-05-25T14:14:47Z,2019-05-27T19:45:39Z,,"Hi!
I am very much interested and working over increasing scalability of GATK4 tool performances. There is explicit parameter setting for increased number of nodes over multi-node cluster. But currently I am using single node SPARK cluster and want to check for the GATK4 performances over multi-core machine. What parameter I have to deal with to increase the allotted number of cores?

Waiting for your reply.  ",ambarishK,https://github.com/ncsa/MayomicsVC/issues/107
