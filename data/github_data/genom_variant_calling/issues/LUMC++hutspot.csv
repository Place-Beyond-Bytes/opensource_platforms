MDU6SXNzdWU0NjQxMjc3NTU=,Update bwa to post-january 2019 version,OPEN,2019-07-04T08:13:02Z,2019-07-04T13:03:27Z,,"There's a CVE for BWA that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by providing a malicious .alt file: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10269#vulnCurrentDescriptionTitle

This has been fixed in BWA in https://github.com/lh3/bwa/pull/232 

However, there is no official BWA release since October 2017. Bioconda, and therefore biocontainers, also use the latest official release. 

@rhpvorderman @Redmar-van-den-Berg Thoughts? Probably make our own container based off most recent BWA master branch?
