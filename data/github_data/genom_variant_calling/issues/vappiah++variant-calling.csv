I_kwDOGpQ7kM5H1S8C,variant calling from multiple files using snippy,CLOSED,2022-04-15T01:12:57Z,2022-04-25T14:04:52Z,2022-04-25T14:04:52Z,"Hi,

I am following your videos and they are very helpful for me especially to understand fundamental bioinformatics. I am trying to run snippy with multiple files using ""snippy-multi input.tab --ref Reference.gbk --cpus 16 > runme.sh"". After running snippy it gives me VARIANTS 0 in core.txt for reference. I am not sure if it is normal or something wrong with snippy installation. I am wondering if you can help me in this issue.
