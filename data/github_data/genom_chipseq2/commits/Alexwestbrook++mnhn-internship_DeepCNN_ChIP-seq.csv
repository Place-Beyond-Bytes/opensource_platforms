GC_energy has been changed to compute a sliding GC over the sequence and then take its rmse relative to the target, this allows for local control of GC content. Other than that code has been reworked to include get_pred_start_and_stop and pad_sequences functions, the first to extract pred_start and pred_stop from model output type (winsize, head_interval, middle) and the second to add the flanking sequences. seen_bases has been renamed to bases_occs.
