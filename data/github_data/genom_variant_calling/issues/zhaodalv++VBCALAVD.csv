Do you have background and reference files built for Hg38?  Any docker image for this tool? The install is failing.  I'd like to give this a try with our ctDNA datasets.

Thanks, David",DavidAustinNix,https://github.com/zhaodalv/VBCALAVD/issues/1
I_kwDOCuo1lc5RBEAG,Size of virtual families with alt allele,OPEN,2022-09-01T18:16:47Z,2022-09-01T18:16:47Z,,"Hello,

I'm looking to gather information about the families that contain the alternate allele. It looks like this idea was started on line 63 of virtual_family.py but I don't think this is returned by that function. Is there a simple way to extract this data? Mean size of families that have the alternate allele would be very helpful. 

Cheers,

Brian ",BrianLohman,https://github.com/zhaodalv/VBCALAVD/issues/2
