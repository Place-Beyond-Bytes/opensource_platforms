it would be great if you could provide a minimal example without the user controls and/or the graph.

MDU6SXNzdWU1NTcxNjM3MQ==,Provide an reusable example,OPEN,2015-01-28T05:32:09Z,2015-01-28T05:32:09Z,,"Hi there,

it would be great if one is able to instantiate your component. This means you can have multiple instances of your components - this would require you to get rid of all the static html code and references in your main function (which should be a class).

Some helpful resources might be:
- [Gotchas about re-usability](https://github.com/biojs/biojs/wiki/Gotchas-about-reusability)
- [How-To for examples/snippets](https://github.com/biojs/biojs/wiki/How-To-for-examples)

A good example might be [muts-needle-plot](http://biojs.io/d/muts-needle-plot) or [biojs-vis-circularfv](http://biojs.io/d/biojs-vis-circularfv).
