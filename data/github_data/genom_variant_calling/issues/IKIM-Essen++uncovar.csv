> We make it possible to download the derived data behind the visualisations on nextstrain.org for your own further analysis. We’ve made the decision not to make the sequence data downloadable as a lot of the original data sources have data sharing restrictions which this would violate. The genbank & GISAID accessions, if applicable, are contained in the metadata download should you wish to access the original sequence data.

In other words, seems like only genbank and GISAID are sources for sequences, and this will definitely be a subset. In case GISAID should provide additional ones to genbank, one has to apply for access [here](https://www.gisaid.org/registration/register/).

Finally, I went through the nextstrain visualizations, and actually the names like `Spain/M-20224207/2020` seem to be the official ones. Hence, the FASTA headers that we get from genbank should be fine, as they contain these names as well.",johanneskoester,https://github.com/IKIM-Essen/uncovar/issues/2

If a query is assigned a constellation by scorpio this call is output in this column. The full set of constellations searched by default can be found at the constellations repository.

scorpio_support
The support score is the proportion of defining variants which have the alternative allele in the sequence.

scorpio_conflict
The conflict score is the proportion of defining variants which have the reference allele in the sequence. Ambiguous/other non-ref/alt bases at each of the variant positions contribute only to the denominators of these scores

note
If any conflicts from the decision tree, this field will output the alternative assignments. If the sequence failed QC this field will describe why. If the sequence met the SNP thresholds for scorpio to call a constellation, it’ll describe the exact SNP counts of Alt, Ref and Amb (Alternative, reference and ambiguous) alleles for that call.",thomasbtf,https://github.com/IKIM-Essen/uncovar/issues/176

The extraction of the SARS-CoV-2 lineage reference genomes takes about 10 min, even though we vectorised the writing processes. Thus, the ""problem"" probably relates to the read-in of the provision file from GISAID.
Moreover, the script contains a bug, where a file called "".fasta"" is created by the script.

Please fix this bug and do some research, if we can speed up the extraction of SARS-CoV-2 lineage reference genomes from the GISAID provision data dump.

In the report, the ""variants to be highlighted"" are called"" `Variants of interest`(https://github.com/IKIM-Essen/uncovar/blob/master/workflow/scripts/generate-overview-table.py#L206).

This non-uniform nomenclature is confusing and wrong to use for single Mutations.

We should rename it in something like `Mutation Profiles of VOC/VOIs`. Maybe we should even split the `Variants of interest` into `Variants of Concern`, `Variants of Interest`, `Variants Under Monitoring` and find an automated way to get the latest Variants of something. Maybe pangolin repo offers VOCs, VOIs, and VUMs.

Who definitions are: (https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/)

**Variants of Concern (VOC)**
A SARS-CoV-2 variant that meets the definition of a VOI (see below) and, through a comparative assessment, has been demonstrated to be associated with one or more of the following changes at a degree of global public health significance: 

- Increase in transmissibility or detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology; OR
- Increase in virulence or change in clinical disease presentation; OR
- Decrease in effectiveness of public health and social measures or available diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics. 

**Variants of Interest (VOI)**
A SARS-CoV-2 variant : 

- with genetic changes that are predicted or known to affect virus characteristics such as transmissibility, disease severity, immune escape, diagnostic or therapeutic escape; AND 
- Identified to cause significant community transmission or multiple COVID-19 clusters, in multiple countries with increasing relative prevalence alongside increasing number of cases over time, or other apparent epidemiological impacts to suggest an emerging risk to global public health.  

**Variants Under Monitoring (VUM)**
A SARS-CoV-2 variant with genetic changes that are suspected to affect virus characteristics with some indication that it may pose a future risk, but evidence of phenotypic or epidemiological impact is currently unclear, requiring enhanced monitoring and repeat assessment pending new evidence.",thomasbtf,https://github.com/IKIM-Essen/uncovar/issues/344

I_kwDOE7-yYs4_x4Rx,Kallisto Consensus Sequences,OPEN,2021-12-02T22:31:48Z,2021-12-02T22:37:19Z,,"## Feature Request

<!-- A clear and concise description of the feature proposal. -->
Use consensus sequences of the lineages as references for Kallisto calling.

## Motivation

<!-- Please describe the motivation for this proposal. -->
Currently, we are downloading all SARS-CoV-2 genomes from GISAID`s EpiCoV database. However, we only use the first occurrence of each lineage as reference genomes (for later quantification with Kallisto). One could argue, that the first occurrence of the lineage is not representative for this lineage, as the first sequence is most likely ""badly"" assembled and contains usually lots of N´s.

As we have **all** SARS-CoV-2 genomes over **all** lineages ever commit to GISAID available, we could create consensus sequences for all lineages by taking all genomes of this lineage into account.

This can be done in two steps:
1. We would have to adjust the `extract-strains-from-gisaid-provision.py`. We don't only write out the oldest sequence per lineage but all of them into a structure like this:
```
resources
└── genomes
    ├── B.1-genomes
    │   ├── sequence-1.fasta
    │   ├── sequence-2.fasta
    │   ├── ...
    ├── B.1.1.7-genomes
    │   ├── sequence-1.fasta
    │   ├── sequence-2.fasta
    │   ├── ...
    └── B.1.167.2-genomes
    │   ├── sequence-1.fasta
    │   ├── sequence-2.fasta
    │   ├── ...
    └── ...
```
Of course, the naming has to be adjusted.
Moreover, this has to be done fast. Test if `ThreadPoolExecutor` from `concurrent.futures` can be a solution to this. 

2. Then we create consensus sequences from theses `.fasta.

3. Feed them into the `cat_genomes` rule.

<!-- A clear and concise description of the feature proposal. -->
Currently, the workflow requires a [`.bedpe`](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/general-usage.html#bed-format) file for primer clipping. Create a rule which changes [`.bed`](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/BED) files to `.bedpe` files.

Moreover, we should have a default primer.bed file in the resources, e.g. from ARTIC https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019/tree/master/primer_schemes/nCoV-2019/V3. This should be defined as the default primer clipping file.

## Motivation

## Bug Report

<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->
In the new VoC similarity table for the Illumina sample, the VoC with the highest similarity is 20A S 126A. According to CoV Lineages, this is Kongo (B.1.620). 

21K Omicron is rated with 54% similarity for the Nanopore sample. 

However, that is surprising because these test samples come from simulated reads of a B.1.1.7 genome (at Illumina) or were downloaded from EMBL-EBI a long time ago (~October) (at Nanopore). 

The Jaccard indices are currently only defined in the numerator via the lineage-defining variants. This creates a bias. One could also include in the numerator the variants that explicitly do not belong to a lineage. For such variants, one must of course work with a different weight, namely 1 - PROB_PRESENT.
