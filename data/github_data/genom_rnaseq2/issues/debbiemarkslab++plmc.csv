MDU6SXNzdWUyNjIyNzc2NDI=,memory consumption leads to seg faults -- suggestion,CLOSED,2017-10-03T01:25:43Z,2019-05-09T06:54:25Z,2019-05-09T06:54:25Z,"I was testing an large alignment (20k sequences by ~2800 positions) that ended being a bit gappy during my alignment. When running plmc without a focus sequence, the calculation runs into a segfault. Looking more closely, this resulted in an overflow for [nFij](https://github.com/debbiemarkslab/plmc/blob/master/src/plm.c#L664). This was actually ""fine"" because malloc converts interprets its argument as unsigned.

However, of course, it eventually would segfault upon starting to actually calculate the second order marginals [here](https://github.com/debbiemarkslab/plmc/blob/master/src/plm.c#L671).  I'm not exactly sure why it didn't happen when [initializing](https://github.com/debbiemarkslab/plmc/blob/master/src/plm.c#L666). 

You are probably very aware that this should be the case, and, in retrospect, it makes sense to me. It might be nice for other novice users, like me, to provide a formula to estimate memory consumption in README.md or the plmc help string. Or even to exit the calculation with an error message saying that the alignment is too big based on this calculation of [nFij](https://github.com/debbiemarkslab/plmc/blob/master/src/plm.c#L664) or something.

I_kwDOAvDtAc6Pe5Kt,protein nucleic acid coupling,OPEN,2024-07-14T02:49:48Z,2024-07-15T15:09:55Z,,"Hi, 
I am interested in studying protein-nucleic acid couplings, like that of transcription factors and RNA binding proteins.  I was looking at the plmc script and was wondering how I should go about specifiying the alphabet argument, if i would like to include both protein and DNA/RNA alphabets. I was planning to make a multiple sequence alignment, with the covarying protein and RNA alphabets concatenated. 

Example
>DYR_ECOLI/1-159
MISLIAALAVDRVIGMENAMPWNLPADLAWFKRNTLNKPVIMGRHTWESIG---RPLPGRKNIILSSQPGTD--UUCUUAUCAAGAGCGGUGGAGGGAUCGGCCCAGUGAAGCCCAGCAG--CGGAGCGCAAGUUCUA----UGCUAAUUCCGACAGAAG.

Given an MSA as above containing both protein and RNA alphabets, Would the alphabet argument work ""a -ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWYU"" model both protein and RNA alphabets. Note that I included U to model Uracil. The other nucleotide characters A,T, C and G is shared between proteins and RNA/DNA. If the above arguement wouldn't work, would I have to change something in the plmc script to distinctly model RNA and protein alphabets, if I am interested in characterizing their co-complex.

Hope my question makes sense !",kamesh2026,https://github.com/debbiemarkslab/plmc/issues/22
