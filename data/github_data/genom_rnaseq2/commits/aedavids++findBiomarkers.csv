Added  cancerExploration.ipynb
   * we have a bug lungCancerClassifier.ipynb
     + want 'lung cancer/not lung cancer' really got a tissue classifer
     + model did not learn anything

Added a couple of graphing utility functions",2020-04-22T01:54:18Z,N/A

implemented dataUtilities/TCGA_Target_GTex.py.

differnces from Treehouse version

1. does not map genes ids to hugo
There are some ensemble gene ids that map to mulitple hugo genes.

2. tree house version gene expression version. I think this is becuase they select the set of gene ids that are common or becuause of the mapping issue

3. I found it hard to read the https://github.com/rcurrie/tumornormal/blob/master/ingest.ipynb source code. Lot of tick pandas

4. I wanted to a python script version so that I could easily include the load functionaly in other projects

## data shapes
TCGA_Target_GTex
```
print(XDF.shape)
print(YDF.shape)
(19130, 60498)
(19130, 7)
```

tree house
```
print(""X.shape:{}"".format(X.shape))
X.shape:(19126, 58581)

print(""Y.shape:{}"".format(Y.shape))
Y.shape:(19126, 7)
```

TODO:
1. switch our notesbooks over to use our data set
2. explore TCGA_Target_GTex
the data values are log2(TPM+0.001). Are there gene expression features that should be dropped. i.e. log2(0.001)",2020-04-19T19:18:57Z,N/A

create a couple of notes books to explore the TCGA data, and create a simple lungCancer/notLungCancer classifier. The classifier does not work. Not enough positive example

TODO:
- we are using Rob Currie's ingest notebook. Double check we are not using tree house childhood cancer data.",2020-04-17T20:39:07Z,N/A
