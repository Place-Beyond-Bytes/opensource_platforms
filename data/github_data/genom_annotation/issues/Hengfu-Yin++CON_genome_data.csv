    I am a postgraduate from Hainan University. I am very honored to read the Camellia oleifera genome article recently published by your research group，which has greatly promoted the progress of its research. However，I could not download the data “CON_genome_assembly_V1.0_final.zip” even using ""git-lfs"". Is the data invalid？Could you please re-upload this data？

   Best whishes！
                                                                                                                                                                                                      Sincerely
                                                                                                                                                                                                     Zheng Wei",1997Wei,https://github.com/Hengfu-Yin/CON_genome_data/issues/1
