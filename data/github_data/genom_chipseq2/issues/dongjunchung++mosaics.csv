Yet, the version number on github is 1.6.2.  Presumably the version on github is newer than the one on Bioconductor.  Is this correct?

I'm not sure if this file has gone through pre-processing so my apologies if this is not a mosaics error.

I get this error in constructBins. This is after running fastqFilter (dada2) and qAlign (QuasR), as well as renaming the aligned files (.bam, .bam.bai and .bam.txt) to match the samples name. Can you point me to where this error may be coming from?
Thank you.
