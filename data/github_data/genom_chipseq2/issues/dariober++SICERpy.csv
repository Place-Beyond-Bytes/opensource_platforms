Furthermore, SICER contains many scripts and much functionality epic does not. 

I'll use SICERpy to compare epic and SICER to find potential differences.

Edit: of course this might not be so much fun to work on if someone else is more or less doing the same thing. And if you think SICERpy is superseded I should not tell you it is not - I just felt bad having taken (potentially) the fun out of working on your project.

And thanks for the link, our projects have the same aim so there might be mutual interest from users.

MDU6SXNzdWUyNzk5MTE5Mzg=,Can not pass species to SICER.py,CLOSED,2017-12-06T21:25:18Z,2017-12-07T08:29:21Z,2017-12-07T08:29:20Z,"I just installed your latest version and noticed that I get the following error when I tried to use SICER.py while providing a species with the option --species as indicated on your readme. 
```
SICER.py: error: unrecognized arguments: --species hg19
```
I noticed if you look at the help from the command line, there is no species option available :
```
SICER.py -h
usage: SICER.py [-h] [--treatment TREATMENT] --control CONTROL
                [--effGenomeSize EFFGENOMESIZE] [--requiredFlag REQUIREDFLAG]
                [--filterFlag FILTERFLAG] [--mapq MAPQ]

Could you look into this discrepancy?

MDU6SXNzdWUzNjM5NzcyMjE=,get_total_tag_counts_bam gives different result than give_total_tag_counts_bed_graph,CLOSED,2018-09-26T11:15:51Z,2018-09-27T11:14:10Z,2018-09-27T10:13:42Z,"This is on the test data. I do not know if this is a bug in the original SICER, as I find it too unpleasant to get the original running to bother 😳 Sorry.

With a remove duplicates of 1, `get_total_tag_counts_bam` gives 9924, `give_total_tag_counts_bed_graph` 9904. 

```
# find_islands_in_pr.py
Total read count: 9904.0
```

```
# associate_tags_with_chip_and_control_w_fc_q_bam.py
chip_library_size  9924 # added print statement to line 61
```

This can have a teensy effect on the p-values of ChIP-seq data with many duplicates. I guess the easiest thing is just to add a warning about this instead of fixing it.",endrebak,https://github.com/dariober/SICERpy/issues/10
