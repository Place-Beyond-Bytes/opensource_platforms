I think we just display this for the tool somewhere so it is up to the user to handle any licensing issues.  

Also, we could have a ""license"" tool piece that will generate a license directly:

http://yandell.topaz.genetics.utah.edu/cgi-bin/maker_license.cgi

Maker-P might be another option:  http://www.yandell-lab.org/software/maker-p.html

The Yandell  Lab may have additional licensing suggestions as well.

I think it actually calls this tool (which would also be fine), but I don't see a webservice for this (though maybe just a post is fine).    

You can look at Amigo as well, but I think that is just wrapping panther: 
 http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/AmiGO_2_Web_Services#API_Documentation

@kltm is that true (the amigo enrichment is just calling Panther) or are you calling the GOLR backend?   Are you doing a post to pantherdb for this or is there a hidden web-service that you are calling? ",nathandunn,https://github.com/galaxy-genome-annotation/docker-galaxy-genome-annotation/issues/16

Gnomon additionally creates pure ab initio predictions where open reading frames of sufficient length but with no supporting alignment are detected.""

But, discussed with Carson Holt who is ok for packaging it.

There is already a brew recipe there: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/blob/master/maker.rb
