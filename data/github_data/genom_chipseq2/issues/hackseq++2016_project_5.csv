MDU6SXNzdWUxNzYyMDM1NzE=,Interesting questions,OPEN,2016-09-10T21:17:30Z,2016-09-10T21:21:36Z,,"It would be nice to come up with interesting datasets and motifs which could be used to answer some kind of biological question.

For example, provide a dataset from ENCODE or a combination of motifs that would be useful to investigate a given a biological question. I would be interested in looking at the binding sequence for the same TF across different tissues of the same organism, but I'm not sure yet what would be good datasets for this. You can start looking at some ENCODE datasets (https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&files.analysis_step_version.analysis_step.pipelines.title=Transcription+factor+ChIP-seq0) or motif databases (http://meme-suite.org/db/motifs) for some inspiration.

I'll start listing some papers that might provide context for this project.  I'm not expecting anyone to read all of this, but definitely some of the ideas introduced in these can be relevant. I'll also update/edit this post with more content as I go.

**Background:**
- [JASPAR 2016: a major expansion and update of the open-access database of transcription factor binding profiles](https://paperpile.com/app/p/948a54e6-6810-0b6c-b2c9-8f7fb5a2f9f0)
- [Regulatory elements: Putting enhancers into context](https://paperpile.com/app/p/fded014d-c9e9-0c08-bb87-8c29acae23b4)
- [MOODS: fast search for position weight matrix matches in DNA sequences](https://paperpile.com/app/p/bb897525-3641-01ba-af22-3cf6fdd4ac14)

**Potentially useful ideas from the literature:**
- [Reliable scaling of position weight matrices for binding strength comparisons between transcription factors](https://paperpile.com/app/p/ba6ff4d0-0baf-0925-aa18-68076af6a14b)
- [The orientation of transcription factor binding site motifs in gene promoter regions: does it matter?](https://paperpile.com/app/p/6e202664-28c6-0d8f-a65d-c944a8df0dc1)
- [Syntax compensates for poor binding sites to encode tissue specificity of developmental enhancers](https://paperpile.com/shared/L0pn4q)
- [Systematic discovery and characterization of regulatory motifs in ENCODE TF binding experiments](https://paperpile.com/app/p/ef16ba6a-591d-006e-80d7-de8bbb85eb00)
