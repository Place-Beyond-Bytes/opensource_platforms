MDU6SXNzdWU4NzMzNzg1Nw==,Requesting Docker container,OPEN,2015-06-11T12:58:57Z,2017-02-07T07:43:10Z,,"Hi, 

Annocript looks like a great tool but the effort to get everything installed it is substantial. It would be great if you could provide a Docker container or a VM. That would certainly reduce the barrier for your peers give it a try.

Cheers!

MDU6SXNzdWUxMzIyNzgyMzE=,Error connecting to external database with mysqlimport,OPEN,2016-02-08T22:44:15Z,2020-04-22T14:27:43Z,,"I am currently setting up Annoscript to run on SGE cluster at my university, I have to use an external server as mysql server to connect to Annocript. 
Line 1585 from db_creater.pm encounters an error when connecting to external server. 

```
    if ( try_exec_command (""mysqlimport -u$mySqlUser -p$mySqlPass $database $path_to_table --use-threads=$threads --local --fields-terminated-by='\\t' --lines-terminated-by='\\n'"" ) < 1){
```

The error occurs because the host parameter is not passed to connect to external server. I have modified as follows to get it to connect to an external server. Notice addition of **-h$host**

```
 if ( try_exec_command (""mysqlimport -u$mySqlUser -p$mySqlPass -h$host $database $path_to_table --use-threads=$threads --local --fields-terminated-by='\\t' --lines-terminated-by='\\n'"" ) < 1){
```

I have restarted the script and it will take some time before I can confirm if this corrected the issue. I will update asap.

I am trying to install Annocript but when I run perl install.pl, the program just asks me to put the path from ann_works but not from the bin folder. So, when I run Annocript, only the loggo appears but it doesnt run! It prints this: 
ERROR: Annocript has not been installed here. Please execute install.pl in the program folder.

Hope you can help,
