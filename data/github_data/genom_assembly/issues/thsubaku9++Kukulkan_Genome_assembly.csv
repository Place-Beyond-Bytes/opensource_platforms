MDU6SXNzdWU2NzM2MTU4NDg=,DNA read generator,OPEN,2020-08-05T15:11:08Z,2020-08-05T15:11:46Z,,Current dna read generator is broken (since offset value can be repeated probabilistically). Utilize a bag selection based system for read generator,thsubaku9,https://github.com/thsubaku9/Kukulkan_Genome_assembly/issues/1
MDU6SXNzdWU2NzM2MTc3Mjg=,Verbose logical verification,OPEN,2020-08-05T15:13:28Z,2020-08-05T15:19:31Z,,The overlap graph sequence utilizes a nice turnaround price technique to prevent tips and bubbles from being created. Need to check how well this works,thsubaku9,https://github.com/thsubaku9/Kukulkan_Genome_assembly/issues/2
MDU6SXNzdWU2NzM2MTkwNTQ=,Circulation Problem solver,OPEN,2020-08-05T15:15:02Z,2020-08-05T15:19:13Z,,At times the reads may be faulty or we might have insufficient info for our dna recreator. The answer to this is to utilize a circulation solver to find flow rate in our graph while accounting for surplus/deficits.,thsubaku9,https://github.com/thsubaku9/Kukulkan_Genome_assembly/issues/3
