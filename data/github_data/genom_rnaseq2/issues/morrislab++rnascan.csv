MDU6SXNzdWUyMDMxOTYzNTA=,Implement _pwm.c for custom alphabets,OPEN,2017-01-25T19:18:48Z,2017-01-25T19:18:48Z,,"Currently, _pwm.c is modified to support only RNA alphabet (see 1064f24a). We could extend it to also handle the other custom alphabets and speed up secondary structure motif scanning. ",kcha,https://github.com/morrislab/rnascan/issues/2

[Here](http://cisbp-rna.ccbr.utoronto.ca/TFTools.php) it seems you set 6 ... Is there a maximum value for the LogOdds , like 10 or something ?",ZheFrench,https://github.com/morrislab/rnascan/issues/3
MDU6SXNzdWU1MTAzOTU5NTk=,Issues with redirecting <stdout> in python3,CLOSED,2019-10-22T02:31:48Z,2019-10-23T13:21:17Z,2019-10-22T17:23:36Z,"Hi Kevin,
There seems to be an issue with redirecting STDOUT in python3. The following script redirects motif hits to `test_hits.tab` with no issues in python2, but in python3, it creates an empty `test_hits.tab` file, and creates and writes to a file named `<stdout>` in the directory where `rnascan` is executed.

`rnascan -p test_rnacompete_pfm.txt --bg_seq background_prob.txt test.fasta > test_hits.tab`",katenie,https://github.com/morrislab/rnascan/issues/5
