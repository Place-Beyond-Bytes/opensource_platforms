I was wondering if there are any plans in the future to support cram files as input? 

From my understanding, clair3nova does not support cram files at the moment. :)

Kind regards

I am encountering an error while trying to load the BAM file in IGV generated by Clair3-Nova. The specific error message is:
```
Error loading BAM file: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Program record with group id whatshap already exists in SAMFileHeader!
```

The command I have ran for Clair3-nova, from the docker container was:
```
    /opt/bin/run_clair3_nova.sh \
    --bam_fn_c=${proband_bam} \
    --bam_fn_p1=${father_bam} \
    --bam_fn_p2=${mother_bam} \
    --output=. \
    --ref_fn=${refCh} \
    --threads=${task.cpus} \
    --model_path_clair3=""/opt/models/clair3_models/${params.model_C3}"" \
    --model_path_clair3_nova=""/opt/models/clair3_nova_models/${params.model_C3T}"" \
    --sample_name_c=${sampleId}_clair3nova_proband \
    --sample_name_p1=${sampleId}_clair3nova_father \
    --sample_name_p2=${sampleId}_clair3nova_mother \
    --enable_output_phasing \
    --enable_output_haplotagging
```

I would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue :)

I_kwDOLRxjss6cMxc0,BAM output with only chr1 when enabling haplotype phasing,CLOSED,2024-10-29T09:06:47Z,2024-11-04T09:31:46Z,2024-10-31T08:58:42Z,"Hi,

I have an issue I hope you can help me with. I don't know if it is a bug or there is a easy work around. When I run Clair3-Nova with haplotype phasing enabled, I receive a BAM file containing only reads mapped to chr1. This appears to be due to missing contigs not being recognized in the VCF header, as I encountered the following error in the log:
``` ERROR: whatshap error: Input BAM/CRAM contains reads on contig 'chr1_KI270706v1_random', but that contig does not exist in the VCF header. To bypass this check, use --skip-missing-contigs ```

I suspect it is preventing proper inclusion of all contigs in the phased BAM output. I have attached the command log with additional details on the issue.
