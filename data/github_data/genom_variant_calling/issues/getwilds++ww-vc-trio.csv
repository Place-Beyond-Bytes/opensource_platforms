I_kwDOLroVKs6OaE57,GHCR images don't allow call caching yet,CLOSED,2024-07-03T18:18:46Z,2024-07-08T05:18:40Z,2024-07-08T05:18:40Z,"Unfortunately, Docker images stored in GitHub Container Register (GHCR) aren't fully supported by Cromwell yet. The script will execute successfully, but Cromwell won't be able to identify any of the cached results during future runs. We've brought this up with the Cromwell developers, so hopefully this should get resolved relatively soon, but for now, we'll need to switch to the WILDS DockerHub registry.",tefirman,https://github.com/getwilds/ww-vc-trio/issues/3
