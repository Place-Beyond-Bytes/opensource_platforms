I'm thanking you for MAnorm improvement!!!!!! You made my day!

But, please, could you explain me the meaning of files `gr_peak.bed` and  `er_peak.bed` in MAnorm3.sh? 
I have the following files for each condition:
- replicate1
- replicate2
- control for replicate1
- control for replicate2

And I need to compare two such conditions, but stuck in choosing gr_peak and er_peak. How can I get this files?

Sorry, this is not my major and I'm learning. 

Thank you a lot for the answer, Sergey

Your method, MAnorm3, is one of several methods that am using for my research. However, I seem to be running into this error of it not being able to open the excel file/it doesn't exist. 

This is everything if the error output file:
