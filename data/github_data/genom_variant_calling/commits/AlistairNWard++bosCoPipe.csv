1. Modified the target regions to use the reference sequences
present in the BAM file.  If a list of BAM files is provided,
the reference sequences are taken from the first file in the
list.  It is currently the users reponsibility to ensure that
the BAM files all have the same reference sequences.",2012-04-17T13:47:35Z,AlistairNWard

1. Added the -scratch <dir> option to the command line.  The default
location on the nodes is /scratch/<user>, but specifying this
command will change the directory to /<dir>/<user>.

2. Added the -fastq-list <list> option to the command line.  Instead
of searching for and checking that fastq files exist, the list of
fastq files in the specified list will be used.  The scripts will use
the path specified, so it is the users responsibility to ensure that

1. Added the command -snp-delimiter.  When SNP calling, target regions
of the form <chr>:<start>-<end> are created and are used in the command
line for some of the software tools.  The region also appears in the
filename.  Some systems do not like having "":"" in the filename, so

1. freeBayes, ogap and bamleftalign were hard coded into the scripts,
so their paths couldn't be altered.  This has been rectified.

2. When filtering on proper-pairs, mapping quality zero reads are also
filtered out.  All mapping quality zero paired end reads would already
be filtered out as having a non-zero mapping quality is a pre-requisite
for being a proper pair, however mapping quality zero single end reads
still required filtering out.  This is now implemented in the proper
pair json script.",2011-07-18T19:02:03Z,AlistairNWard

1. When searching for unique merged bam files, the sample name and
technology appearing in multiple files causes a problems, as the
