MDU6SXNzdWU1MTUxNjg3NTM=,Have some common tasks with other RNA-Seq pipelines,OPEN,2019-10-31T05:09:13Z,2019-10-31T05:10:18Z,,"Here's a few things that could be shared across our RNA-Seq pipelines:

 - fetching FASTQ data from GEO/SRA and ArrayExpress
 - building STAR index and various references
 - alignment
 - quality control",arteymix,https://github.com/PavlidisLab/rnaseq-variant-pipeline/issues/2
