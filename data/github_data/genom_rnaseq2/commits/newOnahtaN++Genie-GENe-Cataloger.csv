I fixed the problem that made the user run the program as an administrator.  You shouldn't have to do that anymore. I also added a few error messages that will pop up, made the README more readable, made it so you don't have to worry about different types of quotes when typing into the local database section, and a few other small things. I would suggest downloading this version if you are planning on using it today.",2014-06-20T22:52:22Z,newOnahtaN

Usage of the Biopython library is up and running well.  Current problems
are that runtime on the queries are incredibly high and variable in
comparison to the direct queries at the NCBI BLAST website.  A query
using this program usually takes 17- 100 seconds, where as on the site
it takes about 2-4.   Not sure why this is - it seems to be something on
Biopython's end.

Implementation of decision algorithm was much easier than expected.",2014-06-03T01:25:56Z,newOnahtaN
