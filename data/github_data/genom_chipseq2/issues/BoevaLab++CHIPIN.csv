MDU6SXNzdWU4Mzg3NzcyMjE=,Error when loading hg38 reference genome,CLOSED,2021-03-23T14:19:21Z,2021-03-24T11:48:45Z,2021-03-24T11:48:45Z,"## Bug description

When running the following command I get an error message:

`CHIPIN_normalize(path_to_bw=pathToFiles, type_norm=""quantile"", RPKM=pathToRPKMfile, sample_name=sampleName, output_dir=outputFolder, organism=""hg38"")`

> Error in CHIPIN_normalize(path_to_bw = bw_path, type_norm = ""quantile"",  : 
  object 'TSS_hg38' not found

## Proposed solution
When loading `data(""TSS_hg38"")` the resulting dataframe is called `hg38TSS` instead of `TSS_hg38`. Changing the following lines in the `functions_CHIPIN.R` file solved the problem for me.

line 1925:  from `D_TSS=TSS_hg38` into `D_TSS=hg38TSS`
line 2074: from `D_TSS=TSS_hg38` into `D_TSS=hg38TSS`

I bin reads into smallBin (30-150bp) and bigBin (150-300 bp).  Relative proportion of reads in these bins has to be preserved in order to be of any use to my question. 

What do you suggest I should do?

Thanks for developing this great normalization technique!

I have two questions:

- Do you update the package concerning the available reference genomes? You offer mm9 and mm10, but we want to use the latest mm39.
- Have you written a Galaxy wrapper for CHIPIN?

Thanks and best,

Joachim",joachimwolff,https://github.com/BoevaLab/CHIPIN/issues/12
