remark on: https://github.com/rubenvanassche/RNA-Stem-Loop-Visualizer/blob/master/src/CFG.cpp#L288

This should throw an `std::logic_error` in case there appears any cyclic unit pairs in the set of unit pairs of the CFG, because the `eleminateUnitProductions()` will then not work. I haven't checked it (yet) what should happen if I put a CFG with cyclic unit pairs in it. I guess this will result in unpredictable behavior. I'll ask Prof. Laenens or Tom what will happen if I do so.

The algorithm for checking whether there's a cyclic unit pairs in it, is quite painful I think, I've posted this question in [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20054637/detecting-cyclic-pairs)

I'll get on this when enough time is left. (or if somebody else could solve it, should be great too :-) )

The reason I want to do this is 
1. I often need the whole set of bodies from a certain variable in a certain production instead of just one.
2. The `std::multimap` allows to have duplicate key-value pairs, (e.g. the key-value pair (A, BC) appears multiple times in the `std::multimap`) leaving my CNF with an exponential blow-up size, (some of my tests indicated that, a simple set of production rules resulted in 25% original key-value pairs and the other 75% were just duplicates of other keys!) which doesn't really make sense. It will just slowdown the CNF-constructing and the CYK-algorithm.
3. The `std::map<char, std::set<SymbolString>>` will make the implementation (of CNF and CYK + CFG) much simplier and more efficient

The `std::map<char, std::set<SymbolString>>` will solve both issues.

I hope everyone aggrees? If not, please reply and I'll rewind it back :wink:

I guess we should each add a separate executable (and thus main()) to provide easy testing for our own implementation.
Mine would be something like this: a ManualTuringTest executable, which takes the name of a Turing Machine in .xml form as a command line argument. Then the executable asks the user for a string, and prints whether the string was accepted by the Turing Machine.

If you support input files containing your CFG/PDA/Parser in XML format (or whatever format you prefer), you should probably do something similar to my executable. However, if you do not support this and do not feel like adding it either, the best thing would be to write an example CFG/PDA/Parser in your main(), so that the other teams can edit it and recompile to test.

I think this was due last Friday, so you should do this ASAP

However none of the other teams have uploaded anything, so we're not totally fucked ;)
(And maybe don't go asking the other teams just yet, if they forget, we don't have to prepare anything for their implementations! :D )
