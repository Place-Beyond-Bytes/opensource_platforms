Do you suggest that I continue to run EVM to integrate this result, so what should its score be set relative to PASA's result?",zhangwenda0518,https://github.com/unavailable-2374/Genome-Wide-Annotation-Pipeline/issues/1

 I encountered the following error during the annotation process. I used conda to install slrum on the server, but I still get an error. Can I use other code or software to replace the srun command?
```srun --mpi=pmi2 maker -base VP -fix_nucleotides new.ctl maker_bopts.ctl maker_exe.ctl```
``` srun --mpi=pmi2 maker -base VP -fix_nucleotides new.ctl maker_bopts.ctl maker_exe.ctl
