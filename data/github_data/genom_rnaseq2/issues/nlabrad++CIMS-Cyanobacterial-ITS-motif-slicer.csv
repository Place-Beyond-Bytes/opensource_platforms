Sometimes it will still fold nicely (but will only have one bubble) but usually the structure is broken. Some sequences I ran that had this issues were MT764787.1, MG255294.1, KF941246.1, KF941239.1. I'm not sure if its always the case that the second one should be choose or just sometimes when the sequence is too short but I just saw it happen a few times.
