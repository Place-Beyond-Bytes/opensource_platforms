Many thanks in advance!",rgraus,https://github.com/carmencita/ChIC/issues/2
I_kwDOB09x0M4_vaUB,"Customize the plots (e.g., change colour; merge samples)",OPEN,2021-12-02T10:41:20Z,2021-12-02T10:41:20Z,,"Hi and thanks for developing this tool, it's very well done and easy to use!

I was wondering whether you have any suggestions on how to customize the plots. For example, when I run the ChIC analysis for several samples, it would be nice to be able to change the colour of the plots (i.e., a different colour for each sample). Also, I would really like to be able to merge some of the samples in one single plot (e.g.,  to emphasize differences/similarities among ChIP experiments). Perhaps this is easy to accomplish and I'm missing something, but any suggestion on how to do this would be great!

Thanks again for your work!
Best,

thank you for your very useful tool, but unfortunately, while using the chicWrapper function, I sometimes encounter the following error message:

I would be very grateful if you could you somehow fix that.",MariaRosariaNucera,https://github.com/carmencita/ChIC/issues/14
