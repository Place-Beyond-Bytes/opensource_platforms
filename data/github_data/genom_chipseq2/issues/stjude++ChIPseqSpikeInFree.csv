MDU6SXNzdWU4Njk3OTQ5NTM=,singleEnd = FALSE for ChIPseqSpikeInFree wrapper script,OPEN,2021-04-28T10:31:55Z,2022-01-14T10:14:23Z,,"Hi,

I was wondering if you could help me clarify the processing of paired end data. 
I've noticed that while you can set singleEnd =FALSE argument for the CountRawReads() function, it is not possible with the wrapper function, which then by default treats the data as single end.

I did try to run functions on their own, but it then stops at the parsing step giving the error:
ooops: you need to change metadata file **\n

Thank you for your help!

I'm just starting to use this tool and was wondering - how are the X and Y coordinates of the two points used for slope calculation determined? I tried running the program twice, first on a given set of samples, and next on a smaller subset of the first set, and got noticeably different X/Y coordinates and scaling factors for the same samples, which was confusing to me.

I_kwDOCiSHO85UWkt0,Normalization factor vs. scale factor,OPEN,2022-10-19T15:38:07Z,2022-10-24T18:33:55Z,,"Hello, 

The SF in the output file (test_SF.txt) is scale factor and DGEList function in edgeR needs normalization factors. So I think the 
norm.factors should be 1/SF.

> dge <- DGEList(counts = counts, group = GROUP, norm.factors = SF)

should be:

> dge <- DGEList(counts = counts, group = GROUP, norm.factors = 1/SF)

And in the part: What happens if 100% complete loss is expected? You just used 1/SF. This is a little confusing. 

Would you please clarify this issue?

If I have an experiment with two different antibodies, one (anti-A) showing a lower signal in western blot, and the other (anti-B) not showing much change, could I use ChIPseqSpikeInFree for data collected from both antibodies, or should I only use it for anti-A? Both antibodies target H3.
