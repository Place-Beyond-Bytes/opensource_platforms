MDU6SXNzdWU2MTE1NTg1MDM=,multiple DE gene list for one TF,CLOSED,2020-05-04T01:38:01Z,2020-05-16T05:20:47Z,2020-05-16T05:20:47Z,"Does one TF allow multiple DE gene list? 
For example, there are two lines fo mutants bzip76-1 and bzip76-2 with wildtype. 
Do I keep two lists as **bzip76-1 vs wt** and **bzip76-2 vs wt**?

Or combine them together? Is so, should I use a union or intersection?",timedreamer,https://github.com/timedreamer/riceTFs/issues/1

2. I added the info to the **treatment** column in `SraRunTable_20200430_11SRP.tsv` file.

3. There are two SRA correspondent to one GSM. At first, I thought they split the single-end files because of the file size. However, they all have the same number of reads. So I think they are actually paired-end reads! But which is read1 and which is read2 is not clear.

MDU6SXNzdWU2MTIxNjM2OTA=,problems with MADS78/79,CLOSED,2020-05-04T20:57:39Z,2020-05-06T16:25:51Z,2020-05-06T16:25:51Z,"1. The data was from this [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31818903).

2. In the paper TableS3, there are **14** libraries. However, only **12** in the GEO/SRA. Missing one WT-48HAF and one WT-72-HAF.

3. There is only one replicate of **genotype x time** combination. For example, one replicate of **OE78 x 48HAF**. So there is no way to do good the statistical tests. See table below.

MDU6SXNzdWU2MTk2MTA1MDg=,OsTF1L(Rock 10) few peaks,OPEN,2020-05-17T04:55:54Z,2020-05-17T04:55:54Z,,"It's not clear how they call peaks for this TF in the paper. I have many issues with the dataset.

1.  There are no **control** or **input** for *Roc10-myc α-myc*. 
2. The GEO supplementary tables are very confusing. What's the meaning for *46*, *H3K4me3*, *H3K27me3*? *46* probably means transgenic plants?
3. How were the binding sites in **Table 1** calculated? I thought they were anti-myc. But in the GEO tables, many of them were labeled something else, like `chr03-7132344-7133928-NT-H3K4me3-7455`. Besides, the peak range is too long, probably from `--broad` in MACS? But should TF use this setting?

In summary, I re-did the analysis using the same pipeline as PE.
Only **SRR5164450 Roc10-myc α-myc ChIPseq** was used for peak calling.  
I have to use `--nomodel --extsize 147`, otherwise, no peaks could be found. 

In the end I got **161** peaks correspondent to **85** genes (within 2kb region)

> After sequencing, 185, 6125, 220, 455 peaks were finally obtained respectively in OX127H, OX127N, OX129H and OX129N.

However, I got: 52--> NAC127H; 179--> NAC127N; 132-->NAC129H; 139-->NAC129N.

I tried some several settings in `masc2`, but always have fewer peaks than reported.
The method that got more peaks would be analyzing three reps individually with the control. Then combine all the peaks.
