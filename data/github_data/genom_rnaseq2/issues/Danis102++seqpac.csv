I was thinking that it could be nice to add an argument to plotting functions for what color palette to use in the graphs (using your rgb_vec_sports as standard if nothing else is specified)
If you think it's a good idea I can have a look at adding it!

I'm having some problems with the analysis;
1. When I start the analysis with my trimmed samples, it does not detect any hits with the tRNA and miRNA I indexed in the analysis.
2. How can I index multiple tRNA fasta files as a single reference?
3. How can I make this classification for miRNA in the ""Hierarchical classification with simplify_reanno"" step?
4. In the ""Simple stacked bars and pie charts"" section, in the PAC_stackbar(pac, anno_target=list(""Biotypes_mis0"")) code, there is ""Error in `[.data.frame`(PAC$Anno, , anno_target[[1]]) :
   I can't get past the ""undefined columns selected"" error.
