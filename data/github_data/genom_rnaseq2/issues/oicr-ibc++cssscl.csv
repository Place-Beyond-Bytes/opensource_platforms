MDU6SXNzdWUxNjI1MzQxNTY=,plzip fatal error dependency,CLOSED,2016-06-27T19:54:54Z,2016-07-12T13:20:22Z,2016-07-12T13:20:22Z,"Hi,
I know that plzip is not your program but it is a dependency. I have all dependencies installed including lzlib-1.8 and also tried lzlib-1.5. lzip runs without error, but plzip will not compile without fatal error. I searched online and could find no mention of this error. I do not have root priveleges so can not do apt-get, I configured everything with the --prefix=$HOME.

gcc 4.4.7 also tried gcc 5.2.0
linux with tsch or zsh

The error is in not finding lzlib.h. I put it in the path it is also in /include. I have no idea why it isnt working. 

Any advice?

error with gcc 5.2.0:

Does your tool work without any reference genome? If I would provide fasta files with chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes would your tool remove these genomes too?

Thank you in advance.
