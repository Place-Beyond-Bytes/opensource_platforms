When already having CCS consensus reads cleaned from primer sequences and no raw subreads, it would be very helpful to have an option to enter the pipeline at step 3 (detect and remove chimeric reads).",reginabohnert,https://github.com/nf-core/isoseq/issues/10

I have downloaded subreads.fastq.gz file from SRR. I have tried Picard, sam-dump, reformat.sh to convert to unaligned.subreads.bam file so that I can run CCS.
However, seems like none of the tools perfectly convert subreads.fastq to subreads.bam for Pacbio Iso-seq bam format.
Is there any suggestion to convert fastq to bam so that it is compatible to CCS?",LEESojung1998,https://github.com/nf-core/isoseq/issues/16

First, thanks for sharing this wonderful resource! 

While the pipeline did not produce any major errors (though it appeared it was using more memory than assigned using parameters), it seems that GSTAMA did not annotate with actual gene names or other easily interpretable metrics (e.g. exons). It would be great if you could include in the pipeline additional modules to do that 
or at least suggest steps for post-processing the pipelines output to do so. 
For example, would you recommend to proceed with 'pigeon classify' and 'pigeon filter' from iso-seq or other alternatives?
Advice towards final isoform visualization would be also highly appreciated

Thank you again,

Hi!  I have the same questions as [LEESojung1998](https://github.com/LEESojung1998) mentioned above that fastq.gz cannot be converted into subreads.bam files and I can't even distinguish whether the fastq files are subreads or ccs reads, can I get some help?

To prevent breaking this pipeline in the near future, the nf-validation version should be pinned to version 1.1.3 like:

```
plugins {
    id 'nf-validation@1.1.3'
}

Hi,

When I tried to run the test profile provided from nf-core the pipeline crashed in the ISOSEQ3_REFINE process. Command exit status 139 and the command error was this:
`.command.sh: line 8:    38 Segmentation fault      isoseq3 refine -j 2 alz.chunk3_flnc.NEB_5p--NEB_Clontech_3p.bam primers.fasta alz.chunk3.bam`

The nexflow logfile is added as a file. 

I tried running the command provided below, using the containers singularity and conda. Both encountered the exact same issue. 

`nextflow run nf-core/isoseq -profile test,singularity --outdir /exports/sascstudent/yezegers/results/test/isoseq `

I hope this helps to locate the issue.

Dear all, 
Thank you for your work and the pipeline.
I am running your isoseq nf pipeline on PacBio reads.
I am getting an error during tama::collapse step. 
I have attached the nexflow.log and a snapshot of the work directory containing the command and output files generated before crashing.
Thank you for your help on this and please let me know if you need more info.
Jonathan
