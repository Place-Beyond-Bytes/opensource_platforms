I just read your interesting story in Medium and try to run the ipython notebook. However, the example dataset in Dropbox (https://www.dropbox.com/s/fwyvu24hdxqv06i/VariantNet_testing_data.tgz) is not available. How big are these files, can it be downloaded in other place?

Thanks.",ai4pharma,https://github.com/pb-jchin/VariantNET/issues/1
