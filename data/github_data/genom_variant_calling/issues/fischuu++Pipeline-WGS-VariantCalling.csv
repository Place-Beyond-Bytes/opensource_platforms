MDU6SXNzdWU4MDA5Njk1NDU=,Merge the coverage.sample_summary files,OPEN,2021-02-04T06:15:51Z,2021-02-04T06:36:39Z,,"Currently the summary is printed for each sample. It would be nice, if this information could be merged into a single file",fischuu,https://github.com/fischuu/Pipeline-WGS-VariantCalling/issues/1
MDU6SXNzdWU4MDA5NzA1MjA=,Only use sampleSheet.tsv,OPEN,2021-02-04T06:17:36Z,2021-02-04T06:18:01Z,,"Change the pipeline that the only input would be a sampleSHeet.tsv file that contains all required information. Further, it should contain the rawsample file names, to get that also more universal (e.g. currently it is coded in a style like `{rawsamples}_R1_001.fastq.gz`. That is rather restrictive and requires maybe lots of renaming for other users.",fischuu,https://github.com/fischuu/Pipeline-WGS-VariantCalling/issues/2
MDU6SXNzdWU4MDA5NzIxMTY=,rule merge_bam_files is a disaster,OPEN,2021-02-04T06:20:21Z,2021-02-04T06:20:21Z,,"Currently I hard-coded the merging of BAMs of the different lanes!!! That was just a quick fix for the data submission, but before releasing the pipeline this needs to be fixed. Do it in the same way as you did it with merging the gvcfs, but not the whole input, but limit it to the different lanes of a single sample.",fischuu,https://github.com/fischuu/Pipeline-WGS-VariantCalling/issues/3
MDU6SXNzdWU4MDA5NzI1MDc=,Start the report.html file,OPEN,2021-02-04T06:21:06Z,2021-02-04T06:21:06Z,,"It would be nice to have an automatic report that summarizes the single steps of the pipeline and places the results into a singl, final report.",fischuu,https://github.com/fischuu/Pipeline-WGS-VariantCalling/issues/4
MDU6SXNzdWU4MDA5NzM0MTQ=,Add filter rule,OPEN,2021-02-04T06:22:46Z,2021-02-04T06:22:46Z,,"Currently, the merged output contains all kind of variants, so it is large with lots of noise in it. Add a filtering step to get the final vcf.",fischuu,https://github.com/fischuu/Pipeline-WGS-VariantCalling/issues/5
