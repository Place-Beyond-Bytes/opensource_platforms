I was going through your scripts for the Somatic calling and I saw that in the script mutect2.sh contains a PON file GTEx_PON.

I have this pon file but its in binary format and you have in vcf. 

Can you please tell me how did you convert it into vcf?",pinunQ,https://github.com/BrooksLabUCSC/RNA-VaCay/issues/1
