I'm so happy that this pipeline has been released, I was looking forward to using it.
But while trying it on my data, I realized that the HiC dataset needs to be in .CRAM but I have it as paired .FASTQ (F and R). ",abdo3a,https://github.com/sanger-tol/genomeassembly/issues/34

Hifiasm has built-in purging of haplotigs and seem to claim that purge_dups is too aggressive in purging (https://github.com/chhylp123/hifiasm/issues/162).  Have you done comparisons of the purging done by hifiasm and purge_dups? Would it make sense to allow users to disable the purge_dups purging or allow users to set the hifiasm purging parameters?

I_kwDOHptrP86RGXVf,Broken singularity longranger image + help with organelles workflow,CLOSED,2024-07-29T03:22:49Z,2024-08-16T09:35:28Z,2024-08-16T09:35:28Z,"### Description of the bug

Hi there!

I'm currently using the pipeline to assembly some data, and I find myself having issues with the polishing step. According to the error message, the longranger singularity image seems to be broken or no longer exists. I include here the .log file of the run. 

On the other hand, I had to run the pipeline without the organelles workflow as I have not figured out how to get it running, so I take advantage of the Longranger bug to make a few questions. Is the API key of the singularity secret provided by the HPC admin or is it something that I can find on my HPC home directory? Do i need to run the workflow with internet connection? This last question is because everything has to be run on an offline node, but pulling everything with nf-core tools was doing the work so far. I also include the .log of the organelles workflow.

Thanks in advance for all the help with the bug and the questions. Looking forward to your response.

The current `dev` branch uses the container `ghcr.io/marcelauliano/mitohifi:master`.
I happened to have an old version of that container, from before Oct 2023, which made the pipeline fail when testing it.

To prevent that, the containers should be versioned and the module should be using the version.",muffato,https://github.com/sanger-tol/genomeassembly/issues/52

The [latest version of minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2/releases/tag/v2.28) changes a default setting (`--cap-kalloc`) to reduce peak memory consumption. I keep running into memory issues, with the `MINIMAP2_ALIGN_ASSEMBLY` step requiring more than 100GB of RAM - would it make sense to update the version of minimap2 used in this pipeline?

When attempting to run MitoHiFi it crashes with the following error message:
```
  'parsed_blast.txt' and 'parsed_blast_all.txt' files are empty.
  The pipeline has stopped !! You need to run further scripts to check if you have mito reads pulled to a large NUMT!
```
In https://github.com/marcelauliano/MitoHiFi/issues/58 the MitoHiFi author suggests that this may have to do with the `-a` parameter being incorrectly set. Would it make sense to allow users to pass this parameter as a part of the config?
