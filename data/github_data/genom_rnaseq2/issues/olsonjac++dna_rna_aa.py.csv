I_kwDOGs-nc85CU2hO,Amino Acid sequence appended out of order (aa_seq),CLOSED,2022-01-24T15:03:16Z,2022-01-24T17:45:18Z,2022-01-24T17:45:18Z,The amino acid sequence (aa_seq) is being appended to that list out of order because it is being appended as the dictionary values appear in the rna_codon_dict.
