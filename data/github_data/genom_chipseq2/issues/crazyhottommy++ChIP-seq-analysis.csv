MDU6SXNzdWUyMTU2Njg0NzQ=,Missing summit location when run macs2 with --broad option,CLOSED,2017-03-21T09:00:13Z,2018-02-20T03:03:37Z,2018-02-20T03:03:37Z,"Hi, tommy

Thanks for your post about MACS, it helps me a lot!

Actually I usually use Homer to call histone modification peaks. Recently, I need to use macs to ""validate"" my previous results. When I run 

```
macs2 callpeak -t test_rep1.bam -n test --broad -p 0.01 --nomodel --extsize 147 -g 1.4e9
```

The output files don't have NAME_summits.bed and there is no column of ""absolute peak summit position"" in NAME_peaks.xls. Did I miss some specific options? 

Or do you happen to know how can I quickly identify the summit location in a bed file(The most enriched signal location in a region)? I am new to bioinformatics, I write a small script to calculate the 100bp bin region FPKM then screen the max value...but it is very slow(of course)..

AFAIK it is by far the fastest ChIP-Seq caller :) It also fixes a bug in SICER.

Btw, you might be interested in this: https://github.com/biocore-ntnu/pyranges

Since you are using Python sometimes with Snakemake it might be more convenient than R GenomicRanges (which also is very nice :) )",endrebak,https://github.com/crazyhottommy/ChIP-seq-analysis/issues/9

I am trying to use ROSE to call Super Enhancer between the two subtypes of a cancer, where each group has 5 samples. But I am not sure how to identify potential SE by handling multiple samples (together with ROSE) from each subtype and to compare these with the other subtype.
Do you have any suggestions, I'll really appreciate your help.

MDU6SXNzdWU2MTMwNzgwOTQ=,Difference between Diffbind library size normalisation vs DESeq2 library size normalisation,CLOSED,2020-05-06T06:21:36Z,2020-08-17T02:29:46Z,2020-08-17T02:29:46Z,"Dear Tommy,

I am an avid follower of you ChIPseq tutorials and blogs. I am now looking at part 3 of your tutorial, which is, using Diffbind or DESeq2 for analysis. I was using DiffBind until now but want to switch to deseq2 as I want to control for multiple covariates, which is not currently offered by DiffBind package (only one blocking factor at a time). I have the raw counts generated and I can do the full analysis, however, I have a question regarding library size normalisation .DiffBind by default, does it. DESeq2 vignette also suggests, it does library size normalisation. But the difference that I find is, Diffbind takes the library size information from the BAM files and uses that, which is probably total mapped reada. In terms of DESeq2, since it doesn't have the bams, it probably do the colum wise sample read count sum to get the library size. Fundamentally, will they be different or not? 
My main point is, can I trust the deseq2 library size normalisation method as opposed to Diffbind way of library size normalisation? ",bioinfouser,https://github.com/crazyhottommy/ChIP-seq-analysis/issues/12
