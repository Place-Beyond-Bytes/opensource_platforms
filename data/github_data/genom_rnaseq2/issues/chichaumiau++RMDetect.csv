It seems that RMDetect correctly loads models for kink-turn and G-bulged modules, but is unable to find them in the given sequence. This is incorrect according to supplementary materials of the main RMDetect paper: https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fnmeth.1603/MediaObjects/41592_2011_BFnmeth1603_MOESM173_ESM.pdf

According to it, the output should be:

```
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Found 2 candidates:
 # sequence model ver. score bpp pos cols motif
 1 unique KT 1.0 14.27 0.45 35-51 35-51 GUGAGG-CCAGAGA.CC

What is the reason? Why cannot RMDetect find the modules?",tzok,https://github.com/chichaumiau/RMDetect/issues/5
