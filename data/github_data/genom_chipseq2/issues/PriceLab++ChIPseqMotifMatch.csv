MDU6SXNzdWU0OTEyNzU5MjQ=,package ready for you to implement calculateNarrowPeaks,OPEN,2019-09-09T19:14:46Z,2019-09-10T23:52:13Z,,"@mariam16548  greetings!
I just checked in v 1.0.7, ready for you.   
Best way for you to start, I think, is to study the unit tests.   I think you will grasp them right away.  
````
~/github/ChIPseqMotifMatch/inst/unitTests/test_ChIPseqMotifMatch.R
````
Once ALL of that makes sense, then please study
````
~/github/ChIPseqMotifMatch/R/ChIPseqMotifMatch.R
````
until every line, every comment, all the roxygen markup make complete sense.

Then  let's talk about, or you could just go ahead with, moving your narrowPeaks code into ChIPseqMotifMatch.R.

All this S4 & package stuff is a lot to take on.  Go slow, ask questions.  It will soon be boringly familar!

MDU6SXNzdWU1MzQ0MjY2NTI=,good use of phast7 and phast100,OPEN,2019-12-07T17:10:56Z,2019-12-07T19:23:44Z,,"@mariam16548 Good work on adding the conservation columns!

Taking a quick look - I wanted to check the correlation of phast7 and phast100 scores - I see that some of the scores are NA.  Maybe, after you are done with exams, you could see if that can be fixed?

MDU6SXNzdWU1NTA5ODU3ODA=,"need better names for scripts (variables, directories, functions)",OPEN,2020-01-16T18:41:59Z,2020-01-16T23:00:10Z,,"@mariam16548 

Hi Mariam,

“PlotCode.R”  tells me nothing about what your script does.   We know for the .R extension that is R code.   

The goal in choosing variable names, file names, and directory names, is to give clarity and meaning and context. 

Please use descriptive names at all times!
