In your nextflow script, the command part of each process is simply a call to various bash scripts that do the task (I thought I pushed this code to the repo a couple of days ago, but obviously I didn't).

The current bash scripts are organized as per the image below:

I think for teaching, one can use the bash scripts to to show how a given tool works, and the complete pipeline to show how the analysis can be automated (so no need to make each stage optional).

As @grbot  noted, the bash scripts need to be stripped down of some of the parameters, but not sure which. For example, the [alignment.sh](https://github.com/h3abionet/h3avarcall/blob/master/shell/alignment.sh) script. It is sensible to remove the `-e` and `-F` and `-S` options (since we will be working with docker images anyways for training). I'm not sure about the reamining options in this script though. Anyone has a strong feeling?",azzaea,https://github.com/h3abionet/h3avarcall/issues/1
