I'm here to inform you there is a typo in the `sgRNA_design()`. On line 156, it reads `Efficency_score`, but this should read `Efficiency_score`. There were some other minor quirks that I had to manually change in the function, but that might as well have been product of my own tinkering around with the code.",mroorda,https://github.com/dylanbeeber/crispRdesignR/issues/1

I was wondering if I can use your tool to calculate the on- and off-target scores of sgRNAs that I have instead of those that are selected by this tool. For example, I have a screen that used the Gecko V2 sgRNA library, and I would like to know which guides might have lower efficiency scores (as determined by the on- & off- target scores). 

Thank you,

I believe this will allow for automatic trimming if desired.

The use.names argument controls whether or not names(x) should be propagated to the names of the returned vector.

Right now it just errors out with this statement....
