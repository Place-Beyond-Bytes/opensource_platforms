I discovered MSPC and it seems to be quite useful for our work with peak calling in ATAC-seq datasets.

I have a question regarding the definition of ""consensus peaks"". It is not very clearly explained on the website:
https://genometric.github.io/MSPC/docs/method/consensus

The definition says 

> A consensus peak is created on a position of genome where is covered by at least one peak from the output sets of the processed replicates.

But in the output folders (each folder created for each of my replicate peak calls, I see multiple outputs (the ""confirmed"", ""stringent"", ""true positives"", etc). I am wondering which of those is used to generate the consensus list.

Secondly,  I noted the -c option, and its usage is again not very clearly explained. 

> -c <value>    Sets minimum number of overlapping peaks before combining p-values.

Does the -c value mean the number of replicates where the peak is in the ""confirmed"" output bed file? And is this a criteria for sending (or not sending) a given peak to the ""consensus"" bed file based on whether it passes this filter?

Thanks

MDU6SXNzdWU3MDA0MDk5NzY=,Curious scores equal 0 (zero) in MSPC consensus file for replicated stringent peaks,CLOSED,2020-09-12T23:07:24Z,2020-09-17T04:26:38Z,2020-09-17T04:26:38Z,"Hello
I am using mspc version 4.0.1
I am obtaining an unexpected behavior for the results of the MSPC analysis, where peaks (ATAC-seq, called by MACS2) that are of very high confidence get a score of zero while much lower confidence consensus peaks get an above-zero score. I would like an explanation to help me understand if this is the expected behavior or if I am doing something wrong.

The command I used with MSPC was
```
dotnet mspc.dll \
-i Sample_01_peaks.mspcBED \
Sample_02.mspcBED \
Sample_03.mspcBED \
Sample_04.mspcBED \
Sample_05.mspcBED \
Sample_06.mspcBED \
-r bio -w 1e-5 -s 1e-10 -d 6 \
--output MSPC_output
```


Peaks are called with MACS2 with p-value cutoff left at default value.  The distribution of scores calculated in R for one of my 6 replicates is as follows:
```
       V7                V8                 V9                V10

V7: fold-change at peak summit
V8: -log10pvalue at peak summit
V9: -log10qvalue at peak summit
V10: relative summit position to peak start

In the consensus peaks:

chr9    69305437        69306418        MSPC_Peak_116500        0
```

Same peaks, in the ConsensusPeaks_mspc_peaks.txt file:
```
chr     start   stop    name    -1xlog10(p-value)       xSqrd   -1xlog10(Right-Tail Probability)        -1xlog10(AdjustedP-value)

chr9    69305437        69306418        MSPC_Peak_116500        0       8933.281        0       0
```

The corresponding peaks, in the first of 6 input files from MACSs are:
```
chr9	69304514	69304845	peak_152259	1257	.	4.95997	128.515	125.789	57
chr9	69305100	69305173	peak_152260	123	.	2.02626	14.4003	12.3318	49
chr9	69305445	69306393	peak_152261	3642	.	8.83607	367.663	
```

thus -log10(q-values) of about 125, 12 and 367.

Here is a visual example to explain:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53985544/93006339-fcfa9900-f528-11ea-8c66-041a2e626995.png)

A plot of the xSqrd vs -1xlog10(Right-Tail Probability) gives me this, so at values of chi-square above ~1500, the scores get very bad. Is this a problem with the program not being able to calculate an accurate probability with huge xSqrd values?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53985544/93006459-85c60480-f52a-11ea-9943-6750a30e2384.png)

I don't understand how such a great peak (MSPC_Peak_116500, on the right on the graph) can get a poorer ""score"" than a very short peak. I must be getting something wrong?

Thanks for your help

Thank you for providing this brilliant package to us. I have a question about p-value in `ConsensusPeaks.bed` file. The fifth column is -log(pvalue), and I got many `inf` value in this column, which means the peaks are extremely significant? (If I am right). I show these values to my collaborator, and they want the original p-value of these peaks. And I'd like to ask is it possible? Thank you in advance, and have a good day.",nzx9581,https://github.com/Genometric/MSPC/issues/178
I_kwDOBdseCs5gv6ls,How do I run the self-contained version?,CLOSED,2023-03-14T10:26:16Z,2023-03-16T00:38:37Z,2023-03-16T00:38:37Z,"Hi authors! Thank you for developing this neat little program. However, I have an problem that is not sufficiently documented in the program's wiki (at least not that I could find). I am not able to install .NET for the machine I am planning to run MSPC on because I would be working with a remote HPC cluster. I followed the instruction to install the self-contained version here https://genometric.github.io/MSPC/docs/installation/ but I am unsure as to how to run the program? There are only .pdb files in the generated directory. How do I invoke the command on CLI?

I_kwDOBdseCs5g3_U-,C argument does not accept percentage,CLOSED,2023-03-15T11:02:01Z,2023-03-16T02:52:28Z,2023-03-16T02:52:15Z,"While running MSPC, I wanted to specify 50% for the `c` argument on `rmspc` (from Bioconductor), as described [here](https://genometric.github.io/MSPC/docs/cli/args#c). However, the program threw me a warning `Warning: Invalid C=50, it is set to C=5.` and proceeded to use `5` as the parameter value for the run.

**Context:** I had 5 biological replicated input peak files. The code I use to run `rmspc` specifically was as follows:

```
results <- mspc(input = input_paths, replicateType = ""Bio"", stringencyThreshold = 1e-8, weakThreshold = 1e-4, gamma = 1e-8, keep = TRUE, multipleIntersections = ""Lowest"", c = 50, alpha = 0.05, inputParserConfiguration = parser_json, outputPath = output_path)

```

Is it because I did not use % symbol? I removed it because my VSCode linter disliked that symbol there so I thought it is going to error out if I run the command. 

Tangential question: Considering the robustness of the MSPC analysis under the hood, do you have any recommendation for the value of C? Would setting it to the number of input samples be too stringent/remove potentially `true` peaks? The default setting is `1`; is there any justification for this design decision that I am not seeing?

EDIT : I firstly suspected a problem with .NET but I tried with different versions (8 - 6 - 5) and it is still the same. I also tried with the R package... same results. 

Any ideas?",EvyDuvernois,https://github.com/Genometric/MSPC/issues/212
