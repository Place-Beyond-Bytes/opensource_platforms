MDU6SXNzdWU1MTY4NjM4ODA=,Could you please include header line in the CSV outputs indicating the names of the features,CLOSED,2019-11-03T17:46:25Z,2019-11-08T16:23:09Z,2019-11-08T16:23:09Z,"Hi, I am looking forward to use `Pyfeat` to generate DNA features. However, as I ran the test dataset, I couldn't find any headers in the output CSV files. So I am not sure which feature is which.

I used this command from the documentation (README.md file) 
```
python main.py --sequenceType=DNA --fullDataset=1 --optimumDataset=1 --fasta=/home/user/PyFeat/Datasets/DNA/FASTA.txt --label=/home/user/PyFeat/Datasets/DNA/Labels.txt --kTuple=3 --kGap=5 --pseudoKNC=1 --zCurve=1 --gcContent=1 --cumulativeSkew=1 --atgcRatio=1 --monoMono=1 --monoDi=1 --monoTri=1 --diMono=1 --diDi=1 --diTri=1 --triMono=1 --triDi=1    
```
And checked these output files for the names of the features, but unfortunately couldn't find them. 
```
selectedIndex.txt
optimumDataset.csv
fullDataset.csv
```
Could you please let me know if it is possible to get the names of the features (i.e. headers in the CSV files) in the output files?",rraadd88,https://github.com/mrzResearchArena/PyFeat/issues/2

I would like to use the PyFeat tool to see which features are the most different between two sets of sequences. I created the optimumDataset.csv. But how to know which feature is where? There are only numbers in selectedIndex. 

Kind regards,
