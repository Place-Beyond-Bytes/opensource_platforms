When `call_small_variants` is `false` Severus will have a NULL array for the phasing VCF and thus the workflow will fail.,proteinosome,https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/HiFi-somatic-WDL/issues/1
I_kwDOKTW7486JMMZ2,Sniffles joint calling ,CLOSED,2024-05-17T02:15:40Z,2024-05-23T06:18:18Z,2024-05-23T06:18:17Z,"Hello Khi,

I hope you are well. 

I am a postdoc with Sean at umccr. We had a sequencing and analysis done with you in 2023. I wanted to follow up with you about sniffles.

The joint-calling of sniffles appeared to be run per individual, not per cohort. I am wondering if you found jointing calling on normal and tumour tissues more beneficial than the entire cohort. 

Many thanks,
Min

May I also ask about the naming conventions of the sequencing files, please?

We received a uBAM file named `<individual_id>.normal/m84039_230813_021121_s2.hifi_reads.default.bam`. What does `m84039_230813_021121_s2` denote?

Many thanks,

It appears that either this code below didn't work or the container has the report file that doesn't display the sample name properly.

I've just downloaded the workflow and I'm trying to run it for the first time on a slurm compute cluster on the test data. I'm getting the error message for both the call-align_all_bams-0 and call-split_contigs-0 tasks:

```
srun: error: Unable to create step for job 58474048: More processors requested than permitted
```

I can't see anywhere where I can adjust the number of tasks requested in a job? Can you advise at all?
