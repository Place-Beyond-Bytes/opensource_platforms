I am trying install the asdcid but I faced with the following issue related to conda env:
(base) -bash-4.2$ conda env create -f environment.yml
Collecting package metadata (repodata.json): done
Solving environment: failed

ResolvePackageNotFound:
  - genometools-genometools==1.5.10=h470a237_1

Do you have any idea to solve the problem. In addition, genometools  is available on our server and I can load genometools using module load genometools but I am not sure if it can help. ",Karimi-81,https://github.com/asdcid/Genome_Assembly_Assessment/issues/2
