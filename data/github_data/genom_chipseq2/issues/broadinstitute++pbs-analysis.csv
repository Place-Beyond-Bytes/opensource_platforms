The Conda environment I'm using is freshly created and blank.
I get no conflict by removing versions from the install command.
Would this have any impact on downstream processes?

I_kwDOIrwU_s56wAkS,XY rescaling,CLOSED,2023-12-29T11:43:53Z,2024-02-08T14:18:42Z,2024-02-08T09:45:28Z,"The RescaleBinnedFiles.R file contains the following condition to detect male samples:
```
# is this a male sample?
  if('chrX' %in% bin_df$chr & mean(bin_df$counts[bin_df$chr == 'chrY'])/mean(bin_df$counts[bin_df$chr == 'chrX']) > 0.5)
```
If I understand correctly, it means that chrY in male samples would have at least 50% of the coverage of chrX. This takes into account the whole chromosomes X and Y. 
Given the size difference between chrX and chrY, have you tried thresholds other than 0.5 ?
How does this function behave regarding pseudo autosomal regions, especially given the previous mappability rescaling step?
Is this condition valid for both input samples and epitope samples? 
Thank you.",gitMakeCoffee,https://github.com/broadinstitute/pbs-analysis/issues/5
