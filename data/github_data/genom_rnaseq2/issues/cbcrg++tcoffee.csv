We are running T-Coffee heavily for our ([GeneSeqToFamily](https://github.com/TGAC/earlham-galaxytools/tree/master/workflows/GeneSeqToFamily)) workflow and we found possibly a bug in T-Coffee. When we put same input (protein) FASTA file in different way 

1. by using normal input file and  (`./t_coffee 'temp' -method clustalw_msa -output fasta_aln > direct.fasta`)
2. by standard input (stdin), (`cat temp | ./t_coffee '-infile=stdin' -method clustalw_msa -output fasta_aln > indirect.fasta`)

resulting alignment varies.

I am currently using t-coffee to perform multiple sequence alignment of proteins to study evolution of transmembrane protein. 
I started using the web-hosted t-coffee system, however as I plan to analyse a large number of sequence (1000) I am now using a locally-installed t-coffee (T-COFFEE Version_13.41.139.ca96b3d (2020-07-23 15:47:56 - Revision 7788a2c - Build 604).
I am currently aligning ~140 proteins for a test and I am unsuccessful at using TCS on this PSI/TM-coffeee alignment. 

When I use the TCS web server on this set of protein ( T-COFFEE Version_11.00.d625267 (2016-01-11 15:25:41 - Revision d625267 - Build 507) I get a proper scoring of each residue however when I use the local version (see above) the scoring doesn't seem to work because I almost only get 0 for the residues (same alignment fed to the system).
I am using the following command (which seems to be the same of the one used on the web-hosted t-coffee):
t_coffee -infile result.fasta_aln -in Mproba_pair -score 1 -output score_ascii aln tcs_replicate_100 score_html tcs_column_filter3 tcs_column_filter2 tcs_column_filter1

I ran a test on three transmembrane proteins, I aligned them using t-coffee and then scored the alignment using the webhosted TCS and my local TCS. I obtained the same results on the two systems, however the alignment of these three proteins contain less gaps that my 140 proteins alignment. I suspect that there is something different with the management of the gaps in the scoring system between the two different version of the software.

Could you help me figure out what is happening ?

Im having trouble with T-Coffee Expresso through the webserver. I used the sequences extracted from PDB (from CATH database). I had some errors, I think because no structural templates where found ( http://tcoffee.crg.cat/apps/tcoffee/result?rid=46a0b0ec ) so I have uploaded a list of templates to be used for each sequences. It still failed ( http://tcoffee.crg.cat/apps/tcoffee/result?rid=6f4f9311 ), but I think the issue is that only X-ray PDBs are used. I don't see an option to change to both X-ray and NMR templates, but I found in the protocol that it should be possible with the argument `-pdb_type dn`.

Is it possible to use both NMR and Xray structure template in the webserver ? Can it be another reason why my alignment failed?

Kind Regards, Kamilla

I am running a multiple alignment of a fasta containing ~7500 sequences with these lengths:

```

```
t_coffee -other_pg seq_reformat -in 1_1.faa -output code_name > 1_1.code_name

In addition, t_coffee remains in process state S (interruptable sleep) consuming ~60GB of RAM. After several days of checking the process, it does not seem to move from there. I have tried restarting the alignment several times but it keeps stopping at the same point. 

Do I have to leave it until it finishes? 

Is it possible to estimate how long it may take? I have aligned other files with slightly smaller sizes a little below and I have not had this kind of problem. Could it be due to the large size difference (from 300aa to >13 000aa) ?

Here is a backtrace of the affected portion; the intercepted sequence pointer S is NULL, which is probably the root of the segmentation fault:

is there a place where i can download the original tarball (from 2022-12-09)?

please don't update tarballs in-place, change the version instead (that's what versions are for)? this is essential for reproducible science.

I_kwDOANWOC86DCeJR,Build fails with strict-aliasing violations.,CLOSED,2024-03-20T20:07:11Z,2024-03-22T11:40:36Z,2024-03-22T11:40:36Z,"I tried to compile with LTO: `-flto=4 -Werror=odr -Werror=lto-type-mismatch -Werror=strict-aliasing`

I_kwDOANWOC86HQO_q,REGRESSIVE vs default: different behaviour when printing to STDOUT,OPEN,2024-04-29T14:18:56Z,2024-06-07T10:58:54Z,,"Hi Cedric & Jose,

while debugging the multiplesequencealign pipeline, I came across an inconsistency in the way tcoffee gives its output when told to print to stdout.
In particular, a file called 'STDOUT' is created when the regressive mode is used and STDOUT is given as the output, if the regressive mode is not used the output is printed to stdout (see also below) – I think the output gets handled quite differently in general, as the output format is also different by default.

I think it makes sense to handle the output consistently  for these cases – also supporting '-' to specify printing output to stdout might make sense.
Best,
Leon

```
$ t_coffee -seq example.fa -outfile STDOUT
<snip>
# output in clustal-like format sent to stdout, debugging info in stderr
$ file STDOUT
STDOUT: cannot open `STDOUT' (No such file or directory)

$ t_coffee -seq example.fa -reg -outfile STDOUT
<snip>
# debugging info gets sent to stdout and stderr, 'STDOUT' is created as a file
$ file STDOUT
STDOUT: ASCII text

I_kwDOANWOC86Vpwm2,"""code"" and ""decode"" function modifies branch lengths and bootstrap values",OPEN,2024-09-06T16:01:24Z,2024-09-06T17:05:10Z,,"Hi,

I am using the code/decode function to turn tip labels from accessions to species names. When I do this however, all branch lengths get reduced to 5 decimal places and all branch support values become 1 or 0 (if they were 1.00 before they remain 1, if they were less then 1.00, they get turned into 0). Is there a way to resolve this issue?

Many thanks",kr3118,https://github.com/cbcrg/tcoffee/issues/67
