I want to learn and run your code, but I can't find the data you use, such like
""apa_plasmid_data.pickle"", can you tell me where I can find it？Thank you very much.",Lsxlsxls,https://github.com/johli/genesis/issues/1

Thank you for releasing your project code, and especially the notebooks hosted on `nbviewer`! 

When running [Notebook 1: Engineering Splicing Isoforms (HEK)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/johli/genesis/blob/master/analysis/splicing/splicing_target_isoform_genesis_hek.ipynb) from the Alternative Splicing notebooks I get the following error:

`ValueError: ``input_tensor.dtype`` differs from ``dtype``. Received: input_tensor.dtype=<dtype: 'float32'> but expected dtype=int32`

With regards to line
https://github.com/johli/genesis/blob/5424c1888d4330e505ad87412e7f1cc5dd828888/genesis/generator/genesis_generator.py#L131

Per the [TF docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/ones), `K.ones` in this case returns a tensor of `dtype=tf.dtypes.float32`. Changing the `dtype` for that `Input` from `'int32'` to `'float32'` fixed it for me. I can open a PR for that if you'd like.
