MDU6SXNzdWU0NDAxMDIwODU=,Proposed changes,OPEN,2019-05-03T15:36:50Z,2019-05-07T14:29:44Z,,"- Move length and quality trimming in bonus exercises in QC practical to gain a bit of time (day 1 morning)
- Move ChIP-seq lecture in the morning of day 1
- This will give more time to go explain a bit more the codes when going through the solution of the ChIP-seq practical
- Replace SeqPlots by DeepTools in ATAC-seq practical
- Use data from the same species throughout the practical to be able to show TF, chromatin and ATAC-seq together in IGV at the end of day 2",scortijo,https://github.com/cambiotraining/chipseq/issues/1
MDU6SXNzdWU1MTE0MzAxODU=,Possible changes to material,OPEN,2019-10-23T16:11:34Z,2019-10-24T09:58:15Z,,"In QC practical:
- Change path to folder from cd ~/Desktop/QC to cd ~/Course_Materials/Practicals/QC
- Change typo (Prepare the environmnet)",scortijo,https://github.com/cambiotraining/chipseq/issues/2
MDU6SXNzdWU1MTE4NDAyNDM=,Rewrite DiffBind exercise,OPEN,2019-10-24T10:01:51Z,2019-10-24T10:01:51Z,,"The current DiffBind exercise only uses 2 replicates, not a good example. We should find a different data set with at least 3 reps. One possibility would be the data from this paper:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27980063
MCF10A dataset - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE72931
MCF7 datasets – Use BRD4 E2 samples https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE55921

There are some nice clear heatmap plots of differentially bound regions in the two cells lines and a third ER+ cell line that we could reproduce as a final outcome of the analysis.",AshKernow,https://github.com/cambiotraining/chipseq/issues/3
MDU6SXNzdWU1MTE4ODE0MzM=,Diffbind- tidyverse packages library should be opened ,OPEN,2019-10-24T11:24:32Z,2019-10-24T11:24:32Z,,library(tidyverse) should be included in Diffbind Practical as it is Day 2 tutorial. ,nam10san,https://github.com/cambiotraining/chipseq/issues/4
MDU6SXNzdWU1MTE4ODMxMDA=,Slides on ChIP-seq intro about CHANCE software is confusing,OPEN,2019-10-24T11:27:55Z,2019-10-24T11:27:55Z,,We can replace the slides from CHANCE analysis with Deeptools bamfingerprint tutorial images. H3K27me3 is usually little close to input (broader domains) and we need a properly worked IP sample to differentiate the one already in deeptools tutorial. ,nam10san,https://github.com/cambiotraining/chipseq/issues/5
MDU6SXNzdWU1MTE4ODM3ODQ=,MACS2 genome size parameter space/enter should be removed,OPEN,2019-10-24T11:29:24Z,2019-10-24T11:29:24Z,,"macs2 callpeak -t Oct4.bam  -c Input.bam --format BAM --name Oct4 \
    --gsize 138000000 --pvalue 1e-3 --call-summits
Remove the enter/space before gsize. It ran as two commands in some computers. ",nam10san,https://github.com/cambiotraining/chipseq/issues/6
MDU6SXNzdWU1MTE4ODY0OTQ=,DiffBind - MACS2 ran slowly,OPEN,2019-10-24T11:35:14Z,2019-10-24T11:35:14Z,,"MACS2 ran slowly. Can we have the peak files already done rather than asking the trainees to do this? Anyway, the trainees learnt MACS2 at Day 1. ",nam10san,https://github.com/cambiotraining/chipseq/issues/7
MDU6SXNzdWU1MTIwMTAwMDQ=,ATAC-seq: replace seqplot by deeptools ,OPEN,2019-10-24T15:11:24Z,2019-10-24T15:11:24Z,,"There are plenty of bugs with seqplot
Since students used deeptools the day before, it would be easier to use deeptools to look at the ATAC-seq and H3K27ac signal around identified nucleosome binding sites",scortijo,https://github.com/cambiotraining/chipseq/issues/8
MDU6SXNzdWU1MTIwNjA3NTY=,Include solutions,OPEN,2019-10-24T16:45:27Z,2019-10-24T16:45:27Z,,Include plots generated in the practicals (in a hidden folder we make visible at the end),scortijo,https://github.com/cambiotraining/chipseq/issues/9
