This is indeed quite useful, and we also looked into this issue and find different library prep or exome capture method would give you different profile of coverage.

Do you think it's good to collect (or give people an option to share) this kind of data such that we could evaluate the capture/sequencing efficiency of different method for a subset of gene? This way, researchers interested in a subset of candidate gene (even when they are doing whole genome / whole exome sequencing), they could have something to evaluate / 'QC' their data.

I am not familiar with Clojure. Could you give some instruction how to compile the project and make jar file out of it?
Thanks
