grep '^F' fastq_file returns nothing so it doesn't look like there's any line in the file that starts with an F. 

fpos=984389052 is out of 984389772 total bytes. so 99.9999% of the way through the file. 

I've manually checked the fastq and the last record looks fine. I've also fully parsed the file with BioPython and with another fq parser without error. 

The last record looks like this.

MDU6SXNzdWU0NjAwNDgxNA==,Fails if Qscore>=50,CLOSED,2014-10-16T16:11:25Z,2014-10-18T01:13:18Z,2014-10-18T01:13:18Z,"I'm not sure what the fastq specs are for illumina 1.8 but I think they can have quality scores > 41. 

A quote from wikipedia ""For processed reads, scores may be even higher. For example, quality values of 45 are observed in reads from Illumina's Long Read Sequencing Service (previously Moleculo)."" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format

Files have failed as they have quality scores of 50. Although this is outside the expected range they don't violate the file format specs which I think is 0 - 62 http://wiki.christophchamp.com/index.php/FASTQ_format so I'm not sure if failing is the ideal behaviour.

Reason: fastq-quality values larger than 40? Reads have „i“ - does that quality score, exceeding 40, break the recognition?
