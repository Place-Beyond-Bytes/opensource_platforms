I_kwDODMMfTc5ny7m_,FastVC  is  RabbitVar ?,OPEN,2023-06-05T09:48:30Z,2023-06-05T09:48:30Z,,"Hi:

I have installed this software recently, but I don't see the bin/RabbitVar or build/RabbitVar described in README. I see that the name in realease is FastVC, but it doesn't mention FastVC in your instructions.  Is FastVC RabbitVar?  Why is this not stated in README? 


Looking forward to your reply!
Thanks~",angeladarling,https://github.com/LeiHaoa/RabbitVar/issues/3
