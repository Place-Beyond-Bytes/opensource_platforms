MDU6SXNzdWU1NDk3MDQ0MTU=,cloning glia from github fails,OPEN,2020-01-14T17:11:57Z,2020-01-14T17:11:57Z,,"Hello, thanks for this tutorial. 
Trying to install the software  i found that `glia` fails when
cloning it,  `git clone --recursive https://github.com/ekg/glia.git`  
```bash
$git clone --recursive https://github.com/ekg/glia.git
...
remote: Repository not found.
fatal: repository 'https://github.com/kennytm/rapidjson.git/' not found
...
```
So https://github.com/kennytm/rapidjson.git/  doesn't exist.

I didn't found `glia` in `conda`  or any other repository for Linux so i'm stuck here.",matrs,https://github.com/ekg/alignment-and-variant-calling-tutorial/issues/4
