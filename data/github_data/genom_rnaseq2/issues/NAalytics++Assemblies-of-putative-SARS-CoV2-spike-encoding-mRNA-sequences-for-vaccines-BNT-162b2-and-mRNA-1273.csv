My first step was downloading the PDF.

Now, I have no idea what to do. Can someone tell me what's step 2?

How do I make my own vaccine out of this?

so I've translated the orange regions from figure 1 and figure 2 and they seem identical to me. Could you kindly confirm that?

By running a blast to compare the two sequences it appears that the two sequences have an identical first part while the Moderna vaccine has an extra 585 bases that encode human haemoglobin.
Is this the sequence confirmed to be identical to the one submitted to the FDA or might it be a sequencing or sampling error?
It appears to me that encoding the haemoglobin may produce antibodies that might cause haemo - cardiac issues.
