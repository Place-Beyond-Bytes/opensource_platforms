I_kwDOFeaGwM5S2fI0,TODO List,OPEN,2022-09-28T22:31:04Z,2023-02-14T05:29:36Z,,"- [x] Examine if the raw data can be downloaded directly from google drive to Ceres
- [x] Download and keep the raw data in Ceres. Google drive is preventing too many API downloads
- [x] Rearrange the files and folders in this repository
- [x] Create appropriate Dockerfiles and CWL tool scripts for reproducibility
    - [x] Create CWL tool script for the following general software: 
        - [x] gdrive
        - [x] samtools
        - [x] STAR
        - [x] bowtie2
        - [x] FGMP
    - [x] Genome assemblers
        - [x] masurca (http://www.genome.umd.edu/masurca.html)
        - [x] Megahit
        - [x] SOAPdenovo2
        - [x] ABySS 2.0 (https://genome.cshlp.org/content/27/5/768)
    - [x] Scaffolders
        - [x] Rascaf (file:///Users/gsfuerst/Downloads/tpg-9-3-plantgenome2016.03.0027.pdf) [Uses RNA-Seq reads]
        - [x] P_RNA_scaffolder (https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864.-018-4567-3?optIn=false)
        - [x] Create a wrapper for Rascaf to process from the tar.gz generated by ABySS
        - [x] Create a wrapper for P_RNA_scaffolder to process from the .tar.gz generated by ABySS
        - [x] Verify each scaffolder with dummy data
- [ ] Create the following workflows
  - [ ] Assemble reads into a draft assembly using multiple assemblers
  - [ ] Write CWL script for scaffolding the assembled reads
  - [ ] Merge assemblies, scaffolds, verification with FGMP and STAR alignments
- [x] Check the output generated by each assembler and name them properly to reflect the correct assembler and the parameters used to generate those. Repeat the same for scaffolders as well
- [x] Write a python script to read the outputs generated by STAR mapping and FGMP. Compile it into a single report
- [x] Write up a script to map denovo transcripts to corresponding genomic references. Also, use the stringtie transcriptome to detect genes/transcripts that could be elongated in this way.
- [ ] Add localizer, effectorP, signalP & BLASTp for functional analysis
