MDU6SXNzdWUyMjc2MjMyMzM=,Avoiding to rezip chr-src/ in final steps,CLOSED,2017-05-10T09:44:38Z,2017-07-25T03:25:52Z,2017-07-25T03:25:52Z,"Hi,

Is it possible to avoid rezipping chr-src in the final steps?
This would speed up creating a new database, depending on the species this could be significant.

After a while it exists without creating the database with the following command:

** Checking query data and substitutions files **
* processing queries: 100.00/100.00% *

** Searching database for candidate sequences **
* processing database part 157 (size ~0.25 GB): 85.00/100.00% **

And I realized that the homo sapiens small test file also runs until this step and stops without an error or warning and the database is not created either. It is my bad that I never checked the database created for the test files and assumed that it was ok as no error messages were printed.

I am thinking this could be due to RAM limitations. I am currently running this on my local computer (16 GB RAM). Do you think that would be the problem? I also tried installing this on our computing cluster, but sift4g is giving errors. Those are I think related to compiler version issues but I am using the version recommended (4.8). The error message (following) points to compiler version which according to stackoverflow can be fixed by compiling with 4.9. So I will try that.

Written by SIFT team:
I looked at your gff file and it's missing a few things.  Please look at the gtf examples like homo_sapiens_small or C.ruddii if the explanation below is unclear.

1) Add rows for ""start_codon"" and ""stop_codon""
We need this because the program has to demarcate when translation starts and stops (genes can have 5' and 3' UTRs in the exon). 

2) The 9th column is missing some fields that SIFT is looking for. 

2a) The program will look for a protein_id in the 9th column. If you don't have a protein_id, maybe use the transcript id which is usually a 1-1 mapping with a protein id.

2b) For each row, please specify the biotype. It can be protein_coding  
gene_biotype ""protein_coding"" or noncoding RNA (e.g. ""rRNA"", ""miRNA""), etc. SIFT will only predict on protein_coding rows.
Here's an example on how to change the 9th column:

OLD:
HanXRQCP    BioFileConverter    exon    98077    98226    .    -    .    transcript_id ""mRNA:HanXRQCPg0580291""; gene_id ""gene:HanXRQCPg0580291""; gene_name ""Ha
nXRQCPg0580291"";

NEW:
HanXRQCP    BioFileConverter    exon    98077    98226    .    -    .    transcript_id ""mRNA:HanXRQCPg0580291""; gene_id ""gene:HanXRQCPg0580291""; gene_name ""Ha

This is not a issue, it is more a question about formatting. I'm trying to build a new database and I create my own gft file.
Which are the row mandatory (CDS, exon, gene, start_codon, stop_codon, transcript ...)?
In the readme you said that  the 9th column (attribute column) says gene_biotype ""protein_coding;"" and 2nd column in the gtf file says 'protein_coding'.
In the 2nd column in the Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.83_trimmed.gtf.gz specifies the database (ensemble, havana...) and I think is correct to leave like that.
in the 9th column, In which rows (CDS, exon, gene, start_codon, stop_codon, transcript ...) do I have to put the gene_biotype ""protein_coding""?

I triple checked that all files are in their proper place and their path well indicated in the config file.

Could you give me some guidance?

Besides this, my gtf file is lacking the start_codon and stop_codon features, but according to this open issue https://github.com/pauline-ng/SIFT4G_Create_Genomic_DB/issues/6, the error for that should appear later on. Do you know any tool that automatically edits the annotation file to include start_codon and stop_codon features?

I am trying to create a database for a mammalian genome on RefSeq. The run time is quite long (several days), and occasionally the procedure fails due to various errors (out of memory, for instance). I am wondering if it would be okay to parallelize the database creation by running it independently for each chromosome/contig.

    Hi Isaac,

    I think I get it! Does this happen for a small fraction, like <1% of your synonymous variants?

    When a synonymous amino acid is predicted deleterious, this means the amino acid in the protein sequence is dissimilar to the other protein homologues in the protein alignment.

    The not so interesting explanation is that there  is sequencing error in the reference genome and the reference amino acid is incorrect. The alternative interesting explanation is the amino acid in the protein sequence in your organism has mutated away from the norm. This could indicate a pseudogene if there are lots of deleterious synonymous variants in a given gene. If it's a single amino acid change in a protein, I thought positive evolution would be a possibility, but that's pure speculation.

    We actually use the % of reference amino acids damanging as a QC.  For the human genome, 0.1% of the reference amino acid is predicted damaging. Here's an example:
    https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/sift4g/public//Homo_sapiens/GRCh37.74/2_SIFTDB_stats.txt

    Reference predictions % damaging: 0.1 2842/2341194

    This is generated for every chromosome in the <chr>_SIFTDB_stats.txt file

        Hi Pauline,

        My input vcf is the same for both VEP and SIFT. You are absolutely right. The issue is the sift prediction score. All output from both VEP and SIFT matches. For that particular case and a few hundred more, SIFT predicts them to be deleterious but they are all synonymous transcripts. Synonymous transcripts will not be deleterious. I ran sift with option -t, which means to  annotate with all transcripts"" All Nonsynonymous calls from SIFT match with VEP. It is really concerning and your help will be greatly appreciated. If you need any file to troubleshoot, I will gladly provide them

            Hi Isacc,

            The output of SIFT matches VEP for nonsynonymous annotation? So this is not a build problem. Sometimes, there are alternative scripts and SIFT picks the one with the lowest score. Have you tried running it with the ""annotate with all transcripts"" option?

            I am a little confused because in one email you say: ""Although I looked and it seemed like the region we looked at is a region of the genome with no gene."" and in another email it says ""SIFT matches the output from VEP with the same amino acid changes"". So the issue is SIFT prediction scores, and not the gene annotation?

Do you see any problem with my config file? The output from SIFT matches the output from VEP with the same amino acid changes except the SIFT called many synonymous variants deleterious. What else could be the issue?

What do you think may have caused it? How does SIFT use the variant coordinates? Can there be an off by one error? Although I looked and it seemed like the region we looked at is a region of the genome with no gene.

Hi @pauline-ng 
Once I run SIFT on my variant set, I see variant labelled as synonymous are predicted to be deleterious.
I understand why some amino acid changes would appear to be tolerated and others not.  But I don’t understand how SIFT predict that no amino acid change (synonymous variants) can be problematic (deleterious)

I use  zcat chr01.gz | grep CDS |  awk '($11!=""NA""){print}' | wc -l to check the sites with no sift score. I found 4.3% CDS sites were not with sift score. 
Then I got to ""CHECK_GENES.LOG"", I got ""ALL     98 (43865/44746)        99 (117728116/118341687)        87(102554181/117728116)"". And you said ""Your database is done if the percentages are high for the last 3 different columns."" I suppose 87% 99% is quite high, right? What's the number for good database?

genome, gtf  for creating database and some logs are deposited in supplementary files.

Could you give me some tips to avoid this situation?

Dear Pauline,

I'm running into some error messages (see at the end of this post) while creating my own SIFT database. The strangest thing is that I could see that files were being created in the singleRecords_with_scores folder, and they looked good, but after the programme is done running all contents from this folder are wiped out. I've attempted it once more with higher RAM in case memory was the problem, but I ran into the exact same issue (plus this time I also got warnings because all .fa files in the chr-src folder were already gzipped).

I can confirm there are neither ""X"" nor ""*"" characters (nor duplicate entries) in the all_prot.fasta file. However there are quite a few N characters in the .fa files (in case that matters).

Sorry if this issue has been reported before; I found two instances with similar error code, but they didn't help me.

Thank you very much for any help you may provide.

Best,

Daniel.

I have successfully created the trial human database but can’t create a mango database using NCBI genome and GFF file [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=txid29780[orgn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=txid29780%5borgn)]  

**GTF file**
I believe something is wrong with my GTF file but I’m unsure how to fix it (error code below).  Here is my GTF file and the GFF file that was used to create it. 
[GCF_011075055.1_CATAS_Mindica_2.1_genomic.gff.gz](https://github.com/pauline-ng/SIFT4G_Create_Genomic_DB/files/8347186/GCF_011075055.1_CATAS_Mindica_2.1_genomic.gff.gz)

This is what I have done:
1.	gene_biotype added: I have added = gene_biotype ""protein_coding"" to column 9 for CDS, exon and transcript (wasn’t sure about this one so tried both). 
2.	I don’t have start or stop codons in column 3 but I see you have “updated the SIFT code to no longer require start/stop codon coordinates in order to build a database.”
3.	I have checked read/write access with ls -l
4.	I have triple checked the folders are all in the right spot
5.	GFF vs GTF: In column 3, the GTF file only has exon, CDS and transcript, it’s missing the ‘gene’ that is in the GFF file (along with other categories e.g. region, tRNA). Was there something wrong with the conversion from GFF to GTF?

I hope it is alright to ask these questions on here.

I have a question regarding the output.
The code results in a folder called SIFT_predictions, with alignment fasta files. If I’ve understood it correctly those sequences are with Sw aligned, so pairwise and locally with the query sequence. The identity of the sequences are listed, but what about the query sequence? There is only the ID in the file name (i.e. : ENST000063518). 

1. Can you clarify how those ids come to be?
2. The sequences are aligned locally, so is it possible to get access to the full query sequence, just with its „ID“?
3. The SIFT.prediction files provide us with position specific sift scores for the newly constructed queries, how is this information significant to us? Can it be closed back to the original query? Or is the SIFT4g annotator the sole possibility to get position specific sift scores for the query sequence?

Thanks in advance,
Yakup",yaada100,https://github.com/pauline-ng/SIFT4G_Create_Genomic_DB/issues/55

I have a couple of questions regarding the protein alignment results.
If i have understood it correct, the queries(in SIFT_prediction folder) used in the files are acquired from the gtf file, right?
But they do vary from the sequences found in the gtf file. It seems, like there has been a sequence which has been inserted.

1. Can you explain to me or link me to an explanation on what change is done and how these sequences are created/chosen as query?
2. Also if the change that is done is just the longest increasing subsequence algorithm, then why does the start and end seem to not change?
3. Lastly, this Query sequence is locally pairwise aligned(SW) with the collected sequences and sift scores are calculated. But is this sequence, which is found in the files(*.aligned.fasta) the **whole** sequence? Because the whole sequence is aligned, it seems more like a global alignment.
For example as in here(Homo sapien file):

Thanks for developing this resource to create SIFT4G databases for any organism. It's quite easy to use. I am annotating a new bird genome, the Greater prairie chicken (Tympanuchus cupido). Unfortunately, my database statistics are quite low. When I use UniRef90 as the protein database, I get the following overall stats:

ALL     23 (4351/18874) 39 (16156279/41401234)  15(2441297/16156279)

I thought that maybe a larger database could help, so I tried using the ncbi non-redundant database, but that actually resulted in even worse statistics:

ALL     19 (3572/18874) 33 (13754937/41401234)  6(890807/13754937)

I started with a gff file, and used gffread to convert to gtf. I did not personally create the gff file, but it was created with Maker based on transcriptome data. I am not sure how to assess the quality of this gff. 

Do you have any ideas for how I could improve my overall SIFT database statistics on this organism? When I ran the test cases, I found very high database statistics, so I believe I am running everything correctly. I've pasted my config file below.

Best, 
Andrew

 I went through the tutorial on github and created my own database for mus_musculus GRCm39.106. I then compared it to the one you have online (GRCm38.83), and I noticed that:

1. for most chromosomes the newer version had heavier files, which I think makes sense because they updated the genome
2. In the one online, there are a total of 137 files in the folder while in the one I created there are only 119
3. When running SIFT4g with the new database on previously ran samples, I get fewer hits. For example, in one VCF I tested, the old database resulted in 53 sites in the output while the new one was only 39

I have attached screenshots of the errors I got during database creation. It seems that some files (not sure what these are), weren't in the directory, so couldn't be processed. I also compared the ""CHECK_GENES.LOG"" file and there are six more of these GL or JH files, so that accounts for the 18 missing files as each records gets three files. My questions are:

1. what are these files and how are they important?
2. Any idea why I am missing six from the new assembly?

One suspicion I had was that my internet connection was too slow when downloading the ensembl files that maybe some were left out. I am planning to repeat at a place where I have better internet to test this. But I also wanted to check if you had any additional ideas.",pauline-ng,https://github.com/pauline-ng/SIFT4G_Create_Genomic_DB/issues/63

I did not include the vcf file during in the 'dbSNP' file during the database creation process, so could this be the issue? If so, is there a way to create the SIFT database using several VCF files or a merged VCF file containing SNP information for different strains of an organism with different SNPs within the same gene sequence, as I wish to look at a few hundred VCF files and the SNP effects on protein structure.

I have had errors in attempting to create a database for rheMac10 (or MMul_10). There already is a database for rheMac8 (MMul_8) for some reference. I have my own FASTA reference and gtf file and have successfully created a test database for the homo-sapiens_test provided as an examples in test_files. I've allowed the program to run in excess of 24 hours so I think I've gotten the maximal output possible so far.

I'll try my best to describe the errors and give my output and config. The latter should differ only from homo_sapiens-test.txt in the following lines:

PARENT_DIR=/home/npb0015/reinforcement_project/
ORG=macaca_mulatta
ORG_VERSION=Mmul_10.99

#Running SIFT 4G

# Sub-directories, don't need to change
GENE_DOWNLOAD_DEST=Reference_files/
CHR_DOWNLOAD_DEST=Reference_files/

The error messages I receive are the following two lines repeated several times:

Use of uninitialized value $aa in string eq at make-single-records-BIOPERL.pl line 274.
Use of uninitialized value $aa in concatenation (.) or string at make-single-records-BIOPERL.pl line 280.

Then the following repeated several times:

Use of uninitialized value $orig_aa in string eq at make-single-records-BIOPERL.pl line 551.
Use of uninitialized value $mutated_aa in string eq at make-single-records-BIOPERL.pl line 551.

Then the following repeated several times:

Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at make-single-records-BIOPERL.pl line 305.

And are are at least a hundred thousand blocks like that. Then later on blocks of the following repeated:

Use of uninitialized value $mutated_aa in string eq at generate-fasta-subst-files-BIOPERL.pl line 894
Use of uninitialized value $aa2 in string eq at generate-fasta-subst-files-BIOPERL.pl line 621.
Use of uninitialized value $aa2 in string ne at generate-fasta-subst-files-BIOPERL.pl line 626.

When the program is done it seems to populate singleRecords, subst, and fasta folders with a substantive number of files looking correct. The main folder is populated with log files and the Reference_files directory does have txt files. All other directories in the config file and particularly the Mmul_10.99 is never populated. When I annotated a VCF using the directory it seems as though there's no SIFT annotations occuring.

I hope this has been sufficiently detailed and would greatly appreciate help.",npb596,https://github.com/pauline-ng/SIFT4G_Create_Genomic_DB/issues/70

I have wanted to use SIFT4G on the 11th chromosome of homo sapiens. 
To do that I am in need of a proper gene annotation file, so I used as suggested the SIFT4G Annotator.
The files I've used are basically the provided Database (https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/sift4g/public/Homo_sapiens/GRCh38.83.chr/11.gz), 
and as for the .vcf file, I used variants provided by clinvar, trimmed for only the 11th chromosome.

I will include the vcf file (in two halfs and .txt) as a attachment. 

To get the gene annotation file, I have used the .jar graphical board as well, as the command option on linux
(java -jar SIFT4G_Annotator.jar -c -i annotator/eleven.vcf -d 11 -r annotator -t)

**The procedure results in empty files and such an answer:**

It seems that I got the same result, but for my research object ,it takes about 30 minutes to making the database, it takes so short time that I can't believe it all done.

Any advice?

So it has to be accessible for the program?

I have a question about using reference genome to build my SIFT database.
I have two species (SP1 and SP2, for example). SP1 has a reference genome, while SP2 does not. SNP calling for both species is based on SP1's genome.
My question is: can I use SP1's genome to build my SIFT database and then annotate VCF files for both species? Or should I only annotate SP1, while SP2 needs its own reference genome?
My aim is to compare the number of deleterious sites between the two species.
Maybe it's a very simple question. But I'm really confused as I don't understand the calculation theory well.
Thanks in advance for your attention and time.

Best,

I have been trying to use make-SIFT-db-all.pl to create a database. It all seems to be going well, and files are being created in the directories singleRecords, fasta and subst (the others are empty). However, I get an email saying the slurm job has failed. It says 'Exit code 255', usually after 11h-12h of run at the step of "" Aligning queries with candidate sequences "". Last time it advanced until: 

** Aligning queries with candidate sequences **
... processing database part 1 (size ~1.00 GB): 47.50/100.00% 

It doesn't seem to be a memory problem, as the jobs are using less memory than I requested. Any suggestion of what can happening?

Below is the config file I'm using. 

Thank you very much for your help!

Best wishes,

I_kwDOBKAFmM6WYJyH,No valid queries to process using bacterial gtf to build database,OPEN,2024-09-12T16:59:54Z,2024-09-12T16:59:54Z,,"Hi Pauline,

I am trying to build a SIFT database for a strain of Neisseria gonorrhoeae that unfortunately is not present in EnsemblBacteria. I am using the gtf and chromosome files from the NCBI (from [here](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/013/030/075/GCF_013030075.1_ASM1303007v1/)) but I keep running into the same error when trying to build the database. I've pasted the output below, but essentially when I look at the fasta.log file I get a message saying: ""0 out of 2283 translated to sequences that start with M and end with *"". 

I've manually checked and at least the first 2 sequences based on the gtf coordinates should work. I've double checked that the names match up between my chromosome file and my gtf file, I've double checked that they are using proper linux end of line characters, and I've made sure that my chromosome file is uncompressed and my gtf file is gzipped. 

I've looked through any issues here I can find that look similar, one suggested adding in an exon line since NCBI gtfs don't have an exon tag, I tried that as well and no luck. I am deleting all of the generated files in the directory between each try. I am able to run both of the test cases without issues, so I think this must be some kind of file compatibility issue?

Thanks,
Duncan

May I check if the human database is created okay? 

Secondly, I'm unable to load the [SIFT4G databases](https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/sift4g/) to counter-check. Wondering if there's any issues with the web-site?
