1. Automated download of fastqs from public repositories like GEO
2. Better pause index calculations.
     * Currently defines pause site as within 500 kb of furthest downstream TSS in provided annotation file.
     * Want to move towards using the HOMER PRO-seq ""peak"" calls to identify pause sites de novo
3. Better alignment stats **[DONE]**
     * The way I currently am using bamtools seems to provide trivial stats (i.e., always amazing alignment rates).
     * **[EDIT]** My initial assessment turned out to be false, bamtools is fine
4. Implement CI for automated unit testing **[DONE]**",isaacvock,https://github.com/isaacvock/PROseq_etal/issues/1
