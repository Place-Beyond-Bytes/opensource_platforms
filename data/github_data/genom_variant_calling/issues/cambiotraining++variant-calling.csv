For example:

- https://doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1008527 - the disadvantage of this one is that it's a private mutation to one of the breeds, so it doesn't show as heterozygous in the healthy group.
- https://doi.org/10.3390/genes10050385 ([SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=ERP114732)) - this has 4 individuals, 2 homozygous siblings and 2 parents, who therefore must both be heterozygous. Other individuals are included in the study to exclude common variants. ",tavareshugo,https://github.com/cambiotraining/variant-calling/issues/1
