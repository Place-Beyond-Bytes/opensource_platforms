MDU6SXNzdWU0MjIxNzkwNg==,Modify DIFF_POS_MAX metric,CLOSED,2014-09-08T16:51:01Z,2014-09-12T19:46:51Z,2014-09-12T19:46:51Z,"The current DIFF_POS_MAX metric is not appropriate when more than 1 peak is present.

The modifications includes:

1- Add tolerance value, in % of the max value, which will allow positions close to max value to be considered as max position.
2- Add threshold for the max value so the metric is not calculated when the max is low. Default : >0. When threshold not reached, NA value is returned.
3- Add threshold on position distance for 2 peak value to be considered as coming from a single peak.  Default value = 100. When threshold not respected, NA value is returned.
4- When all threshold are respected, use the median position to calculate the position of the peak when more than one position present.
