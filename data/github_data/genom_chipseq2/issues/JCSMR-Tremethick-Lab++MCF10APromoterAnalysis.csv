MDU6SXNzdWUxOTE2MDc0NTk=,RNA-Seq data post-processing R scripts need to be refactored,OPEN,2016-11-25T00:55:31Z,2016-11-25T00:55:31Z,,"- current workflow pre-processes kallisto/STAR output and runs analysis using sleuth/edgeR/DESeq2
- needs to be re-factored so that the initial abundance estimation/count data is pre-processed and experiment quality controlled (e.g. using PCA on abundance estimates, adding batch information etc)
- this will then define which samples are used in the ultimate differential expression analysis
- after pre-processing, DE is performed
- output from DE can then be used for preparation of reports, shiny access etc
