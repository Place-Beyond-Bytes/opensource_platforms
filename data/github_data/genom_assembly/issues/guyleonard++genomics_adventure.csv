This is not an issue but a comment asking for help.

I want to practice and learn through this genomics adventure course. I am new to command-line and Linux. I am using windows wsl.
I am currently stuck with ""ssh -Y ip_address"". Could you guide me on how to log in and access course files?

Thank you.",SlowSD,https://github.com/guyleonard/genomics_adventure/issues/9
