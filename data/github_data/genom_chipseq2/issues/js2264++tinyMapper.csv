I_kwDOFojKGc5nc2_T,Strand-specific information,CLOSED,2023-06-01T06:59:00Z,2023-06-04T09:26:55Z,2023-06-02T14:34:35Z,"Hi Jacques, I love your tinyMapper, it's so useful and simple for calibrated ChIP-seq.
I was wondering whether you could implement a ""strand-specific"" layer in the code, that would provide information on which strand is chipped for instance (For instance in this paper: https://pubmed-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.insb.bib.cnrs.fr/33651987/): in the end their could be 4 data tracks: the watson strand chip, the crick strand chip, the pooled chip (i.e. the one that is already output by tinymapper), and a watson/crick ratio. 
The calibration genome does not need to do this strand specific treatment of the data.
That would be super useful, especially since more and more people use this strand-specific protocols (like us :))",piazza-lab,https://github.com/js2264/tinyMapper/issues/2
