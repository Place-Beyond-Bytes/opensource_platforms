<img src=""https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\sum&space;\frac{(O-E)^{2}}{E^{2}}"" title=""\sum \frac{(O-E)^{2}}{E^{2}}"" />
The sum is done across the samples, and `O` corresponds to the observed number of reads, `E` to the expected one, given by `E=error rate * DP`.

The problem is that error rate is low, and it is unlikely to have non zero `E` due to the rounding (count data). This gives a statistic at `NA`, because there is a zero at the denominator.",tdelhomme,https://github.com/tdelhomme/variant-filtering-kidney2Hits/issues/1
