MDU6SXNzdWUyNjg4NDEzMTc=,Doesn't work with Perl 5.22? ,CLOSED,2017-10-26T17:12:52Z,2018-01-30T17:18:05Z,2018-01-30T17:18:05Z,"Hello, 

I was trying to use the tool, and it doesn't seem to pass the test. I've got HMMER  3.1b2 and Perl 5.22. Running the test sequences produces the following errors (and an empty output file): 

> Argument ""les,HMMs"" isn't numeric in addition (+) at vxtractor.pl line 489, <IN> chunk 1.
> Argument ""tedHMMER"" isn't numeric in addition (+) at vxtractor.pl line 489, <IN> chunk 1.
> substr outside of string at vxtractor.pl line 500, <IN> chunk 1.
> Use of uninitialized value $values in pattern match (m//) at vxtractor.pl line 501, <IN> chunk 1.
> Argument ""les,HMMs"" isn't numeric in addition (+) at vxtractor.pl line 489, <IN> chunk 1.
> Argument ""tedHMMER"" isn't numeric in addition (+) at vxtractor.pl line 489, <IN> chunk 1.
> substr outside of string at vxtractor.pl line 500, <IN> chunk 1.

Another question I had is how do I generate (and is there a need to) generate the HMMs for animals and/or plants if I would want to run it on the corresponding 18S? 

Thank you in advance! ",apredeus,https://github.com/carden24/V-Xtractor/issues/1
MDU6SXNzdWU1OTI1NTIxNjQ=,Error using test fastas and example command,CLOSED,2020-04-02T11:16:23Z,2021-02-04T17:47:40Z,2021-02-04T17:47:40Z,"Hi,

Thank you for developing this software. However, I am consistently getting this error message:

Use of uninitialized value $values in pattern match (m//) at vxtractor.pl line 501, <IN> chunk 18.
Argument ""les,HMMs"" isn't numeric in addition (+) at vxtractor.pl line 489, <IN> chunk 18.
Argument ""tedHMMER"" isn't numeric in addition (+) at vxtractor.pl line 489, <IN> chunk 18.

Any idea why this might be happening? I am operating in a conda env with HMMER v3.

Many thanks,

MDU6SXNzdWU4MDE0ODU4Nzc=,hmmscan v3.1b1 is not working,CLOSED,2021-02-04T17:22:00Z,2021-02-04T17:47:26Z,2021-02-04T17:47:25Z,"Hey, I wanted to use V-Xtractor, but I cant get it to work with the provided HMMs.zip archieve. 
Using HMMER 3.1b1 (May 2013) I get the following error:
 hmmscan --cpu 2 --max --domE 1E-04 /hpc-home/hildebra/vxtr/HMMs//bacteria//V1leftlong.HMM temp.pid.14030            
Error: bad format, binary auxfiles, /hpc-home/hildebra/vxtr/HMMs//bacteria//V1leftlong.HMM:
binary auxfiles are in an outdated HMMER format (3/b); please hmmpress your HMM file again
Is this an expected error?
I also added some options like setting CPU cores etc, let me know if there's an interest to merge these into the project.
thanks, Falk
