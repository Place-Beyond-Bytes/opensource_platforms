I_kwDOFVJoG85B8ZdU,Issue with na.rm=FALSE,OPEN,2022-01-18T00:04:53Z,2022-01-30T06:27:50Z,,"Hi @ssvQC,
       I am trying to run ssvQC on my Cut&Run files and I am getting this error:

Error in quantile.default(frip_dt$frip, c(0.1, 0.96)) : 
  missing values and NaN's not allowed if 'na.rm' is FALSE

Is there a way to set na.rm=TRUE while running the package?

Thank you",arijita88,https://github.com/FrietzeLabUVM/ssvQC/issues/1

Does ""0"" on the x-axis of the signal heatmaps correspond to peak summit or peak center (or TSS)?

I_kwDOFVJoG86DCx3O,Error in names(cols) <- group_names,OPEN,2024-03-20T20:54:59Z,2024-03-25T16:04:10Z,,"Hi, 

I am new using the tool and I was following the description on the main page using 

```
path <- ""/ATAC-PBAF/AK62/Data/QC""
peaks_files <- dir(path, pattern = "".broadPeak"", full.names = TRUE)
bw_files <- dir(path, pattern = "".bw$"", full.names = TRUE)
```
Then when I try to run
```
# Create ssvQC object 
options(mc.cores = 4)
sqc = ssvQC(np_files, bw_files)
sqc = ssvQC.runAll(sqc)
```

I got the following message 
```
Error in names(cols) <- group_names : 
  'names' attribute [15] must be the same length as the vector [8]
```

Any advise?
