MDU6SXNzdWU0MDk4NDEyMQ==,run_consensus_clusering_using_wm.pl fails to generate clusters in some cases,CLOSED,2014-08-23T20:32:43Z,2014-08-26T01:11:18Z,2014-08-26T01:11:18Z,"For some sets of input sequences, the clustering step (handled by `run_consensus_clusering_using_wm.pl`) is failing without any warning -- only an empty output file is generated.

Here is an example input file:

```
https://gist.github.com/khughitt/393ad7824d407f849162
```

Which was built from a 2M FASTA file containing 32,456 500bp sequences. This was tested using the recommended clustering threshold of 0.3.

For other similar sets of input sequences, I am able to run through the entire pipeline and generate a list of consensus motifs, so the issue has something to do with the set up input sequences. For this particular problem, the empty files results for 4/10 sets of sequences.

I tried rerunning the perl script with similar results, and no warnings/errors generated at any point.

any idea what could be causing this? are there environment settings or and configuration that needs to be added to `setup.py`?

I'm trying to familiarize myself with the EXTREME algorithm as I am a Bioinformatics graduate student & this is one of the algorithms we are focusing on for a research project. However, when I run the 'python ../src/fasta-dinucleotide-shuffle.py -f GM12878_NRSF_ChIP.fasta > GM12878_NRSF_ChIP_shuffled.fasta' command from the README my GM12878_NRSF_ChIP_shuffled.fasta file is empty. I am running the command within a Anaconda3 prompt using a Python 2.7 environment. Any help would be greatly appreciated & please let me know if you need more details to help
