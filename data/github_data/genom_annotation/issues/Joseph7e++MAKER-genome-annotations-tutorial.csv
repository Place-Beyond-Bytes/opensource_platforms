I have 9  genomes  come from  a   same  specie.,it is a huge job. For SNAP Training, can I use only one scaffold to Train three times ,not the all genome fasta file? Then use the hmm file to annotation the all genome. Is it OK?
wish your help.thank you",N/A,https://github.com/Joseph7e/MAKER-genome-annotations-tutorial/issues/1
