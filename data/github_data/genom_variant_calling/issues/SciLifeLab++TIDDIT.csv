It seems great approach to incorporate coverage along with split read and discordant read. 
I am trying TIDDIT and come across an issue. When I looked at genotype in VCF it has 3 categories 
./1, 0/1, 1/1. The latter two are understood but what does ""./1"" represents? 50% of deletions have that genotype.

TIDDIT is running fine for me on GRCh37 bams, but I'm running into a problem with GRCh38.

I'm getting a reference mismatch error, here are the last few lines of output and the error:

I checked to make sure that the bam is aligned to the reference fasta I'm specifying, and I checked to make sure that the chromosome names are the same in both.  The only difference I can see is unaligned reads with chromosome ""*"" in the bam.

Any ideas?

I am using hg38 as reference but I have this error : ""error: reference mismatch!"". Although when I used an other version of hg38 I don't have this problem the script is running well.

This stems from `int2str` function, but when I grepped between versions, it looks like this function is not being used since version 2.0.1, hence this could simply be removed. Could you do so?

Here is the actual FORMAT line for each event:
GT:CN:COV:DR:SR:LQ:RR:RD

As you can see,, DV and RD fields are absent from description . Also, according to the description DR should have 2 integers, however each SV event has only one:

1/1:4:83,148,244:0:3:0.0,0.0:39,223:56,285

I_kwDOAkV3bs5a-2Tv,Update Dockerfile,CLOSED,2023-01-09T22:22:58Z,2024-11-19T09:16:38Z,2024-11-19T09:16:38Z,"Hello!

I was wondering if it would be possible to get an updated `Dockerfile` for tiddit 3.x? I was hoping it might be as simple as:

```Dockerfile
FROM continuumio/miniconda3

RUN conda config --add channels defaults &&\
    conda config --add channels bioconda &&\
    conda config --add channels conda-forge &&\
    conda config --set channel_priority strict &&\
    conda install -c bioconda tiddit
```

but when I do this I end up with:

```
#5 7.839 PackagesNotFoundError: The following packages are not available from current channels:
#5 7.839

```

presumably because tiddit is currently only build for `linux-64` as seen [here](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/tiddit), which doesn't match the needed architecture?

Alternatively, it may make sense to build from source in the image, depending on what tradeoffs you want to make. ",Jessime,https://github.com/SciLifeLab/TIDDIT/issues/101

I'm not sure if this is a bug, but I've has the following error using 3.3.1 and 3.4.0 versions of Tiddit. 

```

  KeyError: 'HLADRB1*04:03:01'
```

It seems like perhaps it's some sort of parsing error, because looks like it should be formatted as HLA-DRB1\*04:03:01 (i.e. it's missing a dash). So HLADRB1*04:03:01 is ""missing"" from my input file because the query is malformed, possibly? I should mention this only seems to be an issue on one of my inputs (Platinum genome ERR194159, using the fasta reference from Sarek iGenome Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta). 

Do you have any suggestions or fix for this one? Please let me know if you'd like more info. 

Thanks very much!

(I have been succeeded for just once). Last time I used Manta's example .bam & reference.fasta files (https://github.com/Illumina/manta/tree/master/src/demo/data) to do it, I received the error that I mention below. On the other hand, I should add that I used the TIDDIT-3.6.0 version. How can we solve this problem, or what is the reason of that issue, could you please enlighten me?

I_kwDOAkV3bs56RyQv,TiDDIT seems to be more sensitive in the version of index files,CLOSED,2023-12-21T00:23:42Z,2023-12-21T11:54:46Z,2023-12-21T11:54:45Z,"Hi,

I encountered an issue while using TiDDIT/Manta/smoove in a Nextflow workflow to call variants. During the execution of TiDDIT, I received an error message regarding older versions of BAI files. Interestingly, the other callers worked fine and completed successfully.

To resolve the problem with TiDDIT, I re-indexed and managed to complete the process. I'm curious if TiDDIT has additional requirements for index files.

Thank you,

I'm planning to use TIDDIT for structural variant (SV) calling from exome sequencing data. I have a few questions regarding the parameters:

1. When using TIDDIT for SV calling from exome sequencing data, do I need to specify any additional parameters specific to exomes? Or will the tool handle the analysis automatically based on the input data?

2. The `-c` parameter allows setting the average coverage. The help mentions that it would be useful for exome or panel data. How should I set the coverage for exome sequencing data? Are there any guidelines or recommendations?

3. Apart from the `-c` parameter, are there any additional parameters I should consider adjusting for exome data?
  
Please provide guidance on the appropriate parameter settings for exome SV calling. Thank you!

Best regards,
Matthias",N/A,https://github.com/SciLifeLab/TIDDIT/issues/112

I have been using TIDDIT 2.12.2 and decided to update to the latest version. I noticed that much larger CNVs are being called. Using Genome in a Bottle HG002 as an example, I see 2.5x  more deletions that are > 1 Mb, and these aren't believable. The older version 2.12.2 has higher recall on the HG002 CNVs using reciprocal overlap.   

Any recommendations on how I can run the the latest version so its results more closely reflect the older version? I want to move off the 2.12.2 version  because it fails on abnormal GRCh38 contig names.",pauline-ng,https://github.com/SciLifeLab/TIDDIT/issues/117
