I_kwDODIFKhs5BEFZO,Staging problem using singularity with combine-gvcfs,CLOSED,2021-12-31T14:32:13Z,2023-05-02T14:22:13Z,2023-05-02T14:22:13Z,"I had some problems with the combine-gvcfs using singularity because the file that is staged is the _list_ of gvcfs rather than the gvcfs.

My suggestion is to have parameter --gvcf_dir which contains (perhaps nested) all the gvcfs. The sampelsheet should then have file names that are relative to this.

I_kwDODIFKhs5WmOUI,combine-lanes improvement,CLOSED,2022-11-17T07:36:14Z,2023-06-05T19:12:27Z,2023-06-05T19:12:27Z,"Hi Gerrit

It would be great if you could modify the combine-lanes workflow to write a CRAM file as output with the extension .md.recal.cram so that it is consistent with the rest of the pipeline. Just a suggestion as at the moment we have to run bam-to-cram after combine-lanes and also rename the cram files with .md.recal.cram.

Thanks,

I_kwDODIFKhs5d77qa,Mitochondrial variant calling pipeline missing a step,OPEN,2023-02-08T12:00:57Z,2023-05-02T14:21:18Z,,"Hi @grbot 

I see that the mitochondrial variant calling pipeline excluded ""Align the unmapped BAM file with the reference aligned BAM and shifted reference aligned BAM"" step described in [mt-variant calling gatk pipeline](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/4403870837275-Mitochondrial-short-variant-discovery-SNVs-Indels-). Any particular reason for that. I am asking this because I don't understand this step either and was wondering if this is really necessary ?

I can see shifted reference fasta available [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/master/scripts/mitochondria_m2_wdl/ExampleInputsMitochondriaPipeline.json)

But there is an issue that I have been struggling with at line 111 on the main.nf :  include { print_sample_info; log_tool_version_samtools_bwa; log_tool_version_gatk } from './modules/modules-general.nf' . modules-general.nf is not defined and nextflow gives me this error: ERROR nextflow.cli.Launcher - Can't find a matching module file for include: ./modules/modules-general.nf.
At first, I thought maybe you made a mistake and wrote general.nf instead of generate-gvcf.nf",Thandeka325,https://github.com/grbot/varcall/issues/47
