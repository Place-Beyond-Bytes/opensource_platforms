MDU6SXNzdWU4NTI0OTU2OTI=,MultiGPS is freezing,OPEN,2021-04-07T14:54:14Z,2021-04-08T17:33:30Z,,"Hi, 

I am trying to use MultiGPS to analyze ChIPseq data, 3 replicates and 2 conditions. It loads the pair-end bam files well, but keep freezing for ever at Round 0.

Input:
-Pair-end bam file (bowtie2 aligned on Drosophila dm6 reference)

Software:
-multigps_v0.75.jar
-R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05)
-Java version ""1.8.0_192""
-MacOS v10.13.6 (High Sierra)

Hardware:
-Intel Core i5, 3.4 GHz, 4 cores
-Memory: 32 GB

Command line:
java -Xmx20G -jar /Applications/bio_info_tools/multigps_v0.75.jar -out MultiGPS_DamID_ --geninfo /Users/tlucas/Desktop/MULTIGPS/dm6.chrom_Edited.size.genome.sizes --design /Users/tlucas/Desktop/MULTIGPS/Design.txt --nomotifs
MultiGPS version 0.75


_No genome sequence data was provided with --seq, so motif-finding and the motif prior are switched off.

However, I realized the output is just a differential point, not peak region, is it correct?
I'm more interested in peak regions, so how to identify differential peaks and then annotate them?
Please advise if possible.
Thanks.",pastaxingxin,https://github.com/seqcode/multigps/issues/3
