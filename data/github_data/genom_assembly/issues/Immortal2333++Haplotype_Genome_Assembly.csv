Should the input file for Juicer be the merged file of hap1.fa/hap2.fa or the merged file of hap1.ragtag.fa/hap1.ragtag.fa after RagTag? Because according to your diagram, it seems that RagTag should be used first.",ErickTong,https://github.com/Immortal2333/Haplotype_Genome_Assembly/issues/1

Thanks for writing the useful assembly pipline. Recently, I used this pipline to performed a haplotype genome assembly. However,  I met a problem in step 4 3d-dna. when I performed run-assembly-visualizer.sh with hap0.assembly and merged_nodups.txt, there is no _final.assembly output, but only output hap0.0.hic file. Meanwhile, two other files of 'hap0_asm.superscaf_track.txt' and 'hap0_asm.scaffold_track.txt' have been outputted. The log file was attached.

Could you give some advices? Thank you for your assistance.",tzjingyang,https://github.com/Immortal2333/Haplotype_Genome_Assembly/issues/2
