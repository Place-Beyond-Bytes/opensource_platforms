I_kwDOMSca8s6V1JTn,SOAPdenovo_array.sh error,OPEN,2024-09-09T11:48:02Z,2024-09-11T07:46:42Z,,"We tried running the SOAPdenovo_array.sh script using 30 .fq files of total size 557GB as input and a reference genome with a total size of approximately 17GB.
The SOAPdenovo_array.sh script requires a cluster with 22 computing nodes and 200GB RAM.
Our cluster contains 16 computing nodes, with 48 CPUs and 120GB RAM each, thus we changed the SOAPdenovo_array.sh script SLURM parameters to cater to our system specs.

However, when we run the script using sbatch, it didn't produce any output. After checking the .err files, we get the following message at the file end:

slurmstepd: error: Detected 2 oom_kill events in StepId=3851.0. Some of the step tasks have been OOM Killed.
srun: error: comp16: task 9: Out Of Memory
slurmstepd: error: Detected 4 oom_kill events in StepId=3851.0. Some of the step tasks have been OOM Killed.

We wonder what modifications we should try in order to run SOAPdenovo_array.sh successfully. ",AlkistisZach,https://github.com/YannBourgeois/Scripts_Genome_assembly_Tgraeca/issues/1
