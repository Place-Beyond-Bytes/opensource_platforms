I_kwDOJ6wNw86V1lTD,Wrong calculation of RX-Input normalization factor ,CLOSED,2024-09-09T12:37:27Z,2024-09-09T15:21:24Z,2024-09-09T15:21:24Z,"Ciao,

I was trying to manually calculating the 'RX-Input' normalization factors from the number of reads reported by SpikeFlow, and I was getting different values w.r.t the ones computed by SpikeFlow.
I was looking at the code used to compute the scaling factor and I noticed a possible error, at this lines: https://github.com/DavideBrex/SpikeFlow/blob/7dd55487d490f4a49e077b175021dbaff9eb2118/workflow/scripts/computeNormFactors.py#L54-L56 `gamma` is computed by dividing the number of `LowMapQReads` (`info_input[2]`) and `NSpikeReads` (`info_input[1]`). Indeed, if I use those reads number, I get the same normalization factors as the ones reported by SpikeFlow.

Cheers,
Alessandro

I_kwDOJ6wNw86YgFGq,Exogenous Reads Not Being Discarded After Splitting,OPEN,2024-10-01T08:33:25Z,2024-11-29T13:15:03Z,,"Hi!

First, I want to say that I really enjoy using SpikeFlow!

I’ve encountered an issue while working with paired-end data. I noticed that some exogenous reads remain in the reference BAM file after the splitting step. Specifically, this seems to happen in cases where the read1 maps to a reference chromosome, but read2 maps to an exogenous chromosome.

Shouldn't these reads be discarded as well?

Thank you in advance.
