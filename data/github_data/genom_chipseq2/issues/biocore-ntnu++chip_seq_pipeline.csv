Thanks for taking an interest in the repo. I'll try to start making develop branches so I have a stable master. So far I have just been pushing to the master sometimes leaving it in a broken state.

I should also change the name from ""ultimate"". I thought mine was the only one of some size, until I found out about https://github.com/lcdb/lcdb-wf ",endrebak,https://github.com/biocore-ntnu/chip_seq_pipeline/issues/1
