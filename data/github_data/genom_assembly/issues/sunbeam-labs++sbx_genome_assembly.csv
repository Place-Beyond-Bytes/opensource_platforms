I_kwDOEEKPJM55ZUqP,add CheckM extension argument,OPEN,2023-12-11T23:02:29Z,2023-12-11T23:02:29Z,,"checkm_tree rule fails with ""ERROR: No bins found. Check the extension (-x) used to identify bins."" When I add `-x fasta` to the command and run it from the command prompt, it works like a charm.

It's also giving me grief about the CheckM.yml input where I have 'Staphylococcus aureus' repeated for every sample name. Not sure what the fix for that is yet.
