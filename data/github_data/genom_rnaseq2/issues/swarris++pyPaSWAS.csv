I'm running with CUDA 9.0.69, Anaconda Python 3.5.5, numpy 1.14.3, biopython 1.71. The system has a Tesla P100 and 15215.931701660156MB of 15983.75MB are being allocated (maybe there's an issue with trying to allocate a millionth of a byte? ;-) )

Great work! I just wonder: What would be necessary to change in the code to let it process the lines in file1 and file2 one on one instead of all against all? 
So like: line1 is compared with line1 in the other file, line2 with line2 in the other file and so on.
That would be really helpful!
