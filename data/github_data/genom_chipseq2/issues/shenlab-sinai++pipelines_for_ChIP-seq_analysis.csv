MDU6SXNzdWUyOTQ5NDAxMTg=,Input files for the script calPausingindex.R,OPEN,2018-02-06T22:43:13Z,2018-02-06T22:43:13Z,,"Hello:
Greetings for the day!!!
I am new to all this chip-seq data analysis. Iam trying to calculate paused pol2 index for my Pol2 chip. Iam able to generate the annotation files for both TSS and gene bodies. But I am stuck with the next step. Could you please clear me about what input files i need to use the calpausingindex.R script? Can I use the bigwig files or bam files after deduplication? can i just use the R script instead of the bash script (A_do.sh)?

Thank you,
