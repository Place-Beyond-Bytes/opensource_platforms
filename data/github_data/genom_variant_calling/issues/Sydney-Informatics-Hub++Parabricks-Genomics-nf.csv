Dear Georgie,

The most recent version of Parabricks includes Minimap2, and I need to run simple Minimap jobs, but I am having trouble using Parabricks on Gadi. Rather than a request for a feature, could you kindly provide some instructions or recommendations on how to achieve this?

I was trying to understand the logic behind your pipeline, but I can't find where you're calling or defining the ""singularity run..."" instruction. This would be my first time trying to run GPU-accelerated analysis. Is there something I’m not understanding about using Parabricks?

Thank you so much for your kind assistance.
