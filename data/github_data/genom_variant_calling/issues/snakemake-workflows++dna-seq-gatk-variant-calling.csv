```

I did the following steps:

1. Clone the repo
2. Filled the *.tsv files and the config file with the correct infos for the run
3. Test using `snakemake -np`. Everything is OK at this step.
4. Prepare the cluster.json file
5. Launch snakemake:

```
snakemake --use-conda -k -p -j 999 --cluster-config cluster.json --cluster ""sbatch -A {cluster.account} -t {cluster.time} --mem {cluster.mem} --cpus-per-task {cluster.cpus-per-task}""
```

The jobs are submitted correctly to the cluster, but they crash after a few minutes. In the logs, I find the error message I pasted at the beginning of this issue.

I was under the impression that the wrappers were downloaded before launching the jobs, but it does not appear to be the case.

I then tried to clone the snakemake-wrappers repo and link it directly with the `--wrapper-prefix` parameter using the `git+file://path/to/your/local/clone@` as mentioned in the doc. I get the following error:

That rule only produces the model built with the [VariantRecalibrator](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360050815872-VariantRecalibrator), but does not use [ApplyVQSR](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360036431392-ApplyVQSR) to actually perform the filtering. 

That means, the output files produced by that rule, `all.{vartype}.recalibrated.vcf.gz`, are in fact the recal files used by ApplyRecalibration, but not actually the filtered VCFs that we are looking for. Hence, an additional rule needs to be implemented that runs the [gatk/applyvqsr wrapper](https://snakemake-wrappers.readthedocs.io/en/0.85.0/wrappers/gatk/applyvqsr.html).

If that helps, I've [implemented this in my pipeline](https://github.com/moiexpositoalonsolab/grenepipe/blob/fdac0fe12c9e81adbbdd3672fcdaa91ca73baea7/rules/filtering.smk#L58-L198), which also offers to set all the resource files needed for the VariantRecalibrator to be provided via the [config file](https://github.com/moiexpositoalonsolab/grenepipe/blob/fdac0fe12c9e81adbbdd3672fcdaa91ca73baea7/config.yaml#L577-L657), so that users don't have to edit the snakemake files.",lczech,https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/dna-seq-gatk-variant-calling/issues/35

I am trying to run this pipeline with 144 samples so the resulting files are quite big. I managed to get it almost to the end, but the last rule (plots_stats) fails with `OverflowError: value too large to convert to npy_uint32`. I guess, I just have to many rows in my `calls.tsv.gz`to be handled. The complete error log is:

This appears while bwa is running to generate the index files ( genome.dict, genome.fasta.amb, genome.fasta.ann, genome.fasta.fai, genome.fasta.pac) and the run stops after the .bwt file is completed, but it does not proceed to the mapping step. 

I cannot attach the config files becuse the formats are not supported, so I am attaching the .txt version of them. 

Could you please help me in solving this issue?
