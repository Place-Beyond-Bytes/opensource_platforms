I_kwDOFtGKNs5Je-6O,Where should I upload my sequence data?,CLOSED,2022-05-11T15:46:46Z,2023-04-23T01:54:32Z,2023-04-23T01:54:32Z,"Dear egochao,
I belived that the command python3 test.py -d data/human/nonTATA/hs_pos_nonTATA.txt -w data/myDNAsequence.txt was enought to  load my sequence. But I got an error. Would you be more specific where should I upload my sequece data? 
I'm a beginner with pytorch so the script is not clear to me.

Thanks!",CoronelVargasG,https://github.com/egochao/DeePromoter/issues/1

I'm working on plant data, can you please tell me the simple workflow of DeePromotor with the input DNA sequence?   
command line details ??

thanks ",Nikhilgunala,https://github.com/egochao/DeePromoter/issues/2
I_kwDOFtGKNs6Eu7VU,"Visual evaluation of models using ROC, and other question",OPEN,2024-04-05T03:15:46Z,2024-04-25T06:15:31Z,,"Hi, @egochao 

It's very exciting that you provide a simple method to train and predict promoter sequences. This is friendly to us newbies in machine learning. I encountered some problems during use and would like to ask you for some advice.

1. Your model uses the promoter sequences of one species for training separately. **Does it make sense if I combine the promoter data of some species for training?** 

For example, I combined promoter sequences identified in more than 60 species of fish and trained a model. I want to use this trained model to predict promoter regions of other fish species, is this possible? 

The final prediction result log：
**for fish-TATA**, 46800 sequences, Test precision: 0.9281830539193475；Test recall: 0.8752403332621235；Test MCC :0.8088365907172335
**for fish-nonTATA**, 77245 sequences, Test precision: 0.934273019764057；Test recall: 0.7893851132686084；Test MCC :0.7428381575465615

This is only the result of one training session. Compared with the training results of mouse and human models, it seems not very good. I am also trying to increase the number of trainings. 

**Can you give me some suggestions on other parameters that need to be adjusted?** 
For example, the “I used the final set of parameter from the paper. Kernel size = [27, 14, 7], and maxpooling with kernel = 6” you use. 
**I'm a little confused whether or not I should adjust it for my data, and how?**

2. In fact, I also used the zebrafish promoter sequence from EPDnew database to try to predict, but too few TATA-box sequences(700 sequence) caused the program to fail to train the model and reported an error. This is why I want to merge more fish promoter sequences together for prediction. 

But this also raised another issue: There may be inaccurate promoter sequences in the data set I constructed myself. For example, it is not a real TATA-box sequence. I put this into the data set for training. 

After all, the data is not as reliable as coming from the EPDnew database. But I can estimate that about 90% of the sequences are relatively accurate. 

**Will this have a big impact on the final model training? How do I do the assessment? Considering that there are errors in the data set itself, what should the final precision, recall, and mcc reach to be considered a suitable model?**

3. I wanted to try to output ROC curve pictures by modifying your test.py, but I failed. Can you give me some main modification suggestions? 
I'm not quite sure how I should structure the test dataset, such as labeling and classifying it. 

Best wishes,

Shuo Li
