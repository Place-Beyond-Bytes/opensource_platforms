congrats for the tool!!!!
I was trying to look information how to use it, but cannot find it inside github.
I tried to go to http://compbio.charite.de/Q/, but gives me 404 error.

It would be great some quick start here! willing to test it.

We've tried installing and running ""Q"" in two different Ubuntu systems,
and in both cases configure/make/makeinstall runs smoothly
but then when we try to run it with ""-t afile.bam"" and ""-o somefolder"" , we get the following error:

""
ERROR: Trying to open BAM file and ZLIB is not available!
ERROR: Could not open <MY_FILE_NAME>.bam !

It looks like a problem with seqan but I don't know what I could do to fix it, any ideas?

MDU6SXNzdWUxMDY3MTU5MDY=,Find no enriched regions,CLOSED,2015-09-16T07:30:28Z,2015-09-18T17:58:15Z,2015-09-18T17:58:15Z,"Hi,

I ran Q on two data sets. For one of them I got results which may be reasonable (I need to look at the details) but for the other one (which is actually a much better quality data) I got no peaks at all. If I run Q with default options it estimates the average fragment length to be 1 (it prints 2^32+1)  but even when I provided the average fragment length it still has not found a single peak (even though there are hundreds of very reliable ones). The original data was paired ends and I thought that this could have created the problem (even though I do not know why) so I kept only the first mate in every pair (and so the strand is random) but it did not help.
Any idea why this happens (and is there any way to avoid this)? I can upload my file (and control - it makes no difference).

Thank you in advance,
Moshe.
