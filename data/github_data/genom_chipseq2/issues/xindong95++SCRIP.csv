I_kwDOEmUVAs5wixn_,Input to impute function,CLOSED,2023-09-08T18:48:13Z,2024-05-27T07:33:31Z,2024-05-27T07:33:30Z,"Hello @xindong95 , I'm interested in using SCRIP software to identify gene targets of some transcription factors that apparently have an important activity on my samples. I processed my scATAC-seq data with Signac pipeline, so I exported peaks by cell-matrix from a Signac object and then I covert it to .h5 format. I planned to use _impute_ function to later use the function _target_ but when I use this code
`SCRIP impute -i $input_path/peaks_by_cell.h5 -s hs -f mtx -p Target_FLi1 --factor FLI1` 
I got the next error:

I don't understand if the error is because  the input file isn't correct or something else. Its possible to use another format as an input file for this function?

I_kwDOEmUVAs57L2Jf,Where is PBMC_granulocyte_sorted_10k_peak_count.h5 ?,CLOSED,2024-01-05T04:21:21Z,2024-01-06T16:04:37Z,2024-01-06T16:04:37Z,"Hi, could you tell me where I can download the ATAC PMBC peak count file ? 

I followed your documentation in https://scrip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/PBMC.html and https://github.com/xindong95/SCRIP_notebook/blob/main/PBMC_python.ipynb

Your tutorial said: `atac_adata = sc.read_10x_h5('example/PBMC/data/PBMC_granulocyte_sorted_10k_peak_count.h5', gex_only=False)`

But I cannot find `PBMC_granulocyte_sorted_10k_peak_count.h5` from 10X website https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets/pbmc-from-a-healthy-donor-granulocytes-removed-through-cell-sorting-10-k-1-standard-2-0-0",wangjk321,https://github.com/xindong95/SCRIP/issues/3
I_kwDOEmUVAs57Mbl_,Is there any edge weight in the output GRN?,CLOSED,2024-01-05T07:20:22Z,2024-01-08T13:21:49Z,2024-01-06T16:04:54Z,"Hello.

My current goal is to build a directed edge-weighted GRN using only scATAC-seq data, and I feel like SCRIP can help me achieve this goal. I'm not sure so I came to ask you

Looking forward to your reply",wshaoYa,https://github.com/xindong95/SCRIP/issues/4
