This could also potentially be a basis for the PICI effort to get reference datasets and analyses for somatic variant calling in place.

Probably we should have a command like `vcb-standard-callers` that launches a ketrew workflow for these callers, similarly to the existing commands which launch Guacamole. Can also have a separate command (`vcb-mutect`) for each caller if that is easier. Ideally it will be possible to run on demeter or on google cloud. Hopefully can use essentially what we already have in epidisco.
