MDU6SXNzdWU3MTQ4MTQ5Njg=,Tiniest issue ever,OPEN,2020-10-05T12:55:11Z,2020-10-05T12:55:11Z,,"Using macs2 v2.1.4 (default install from bioconda in my case), I get an output file of 31 header lines, instead of the 29 described in the user guide. This causes the error:

> Use of uninitialized value within @columnsOriginal in negation (-) at /home/teamgreenberg/bin/RECAP/RECAP.pl line 255.
> Argument ""+log10(pvalue)"" isn't numeric in exponentiation (**) at /home/teamgreenberg/bin/RECAP/RECAP.pl line 255.

I believe this is because RECAP, when run with -e 29 on a 31 line header file, is using a header row to readjust p-values
Not really an issue, just changed the run parameter from -e 29 to -e 31. 

For any new users, to find out how many header lines your version of macs2 outputs, simply run macs2 using default parameters and open the ""xxx_peaks.xls"" file in Excel/Libre Office and count the number of header rows. INCLUDE the row that begins with ""chr start end...""

Looking forward to using RECAP!
