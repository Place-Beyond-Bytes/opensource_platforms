    Hi Azza.

    I hope you are doing well. I have been working on trying to create a program to parse the log files like the one you put on the github. However when I try running it on Stampede/Comet I do not get log files like the one you sent me. I tried with the -L flag and -v, but the log file still looks different from the one you put on the github. I am using swift-t 1.1, maybe the version difference may be an issue? Did you use any special flags? 

    Thanks,
    Elliott
