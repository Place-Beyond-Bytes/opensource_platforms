MDU6SXNzdWUyMDkxNDM3OTc=,Assessment of MCTS-RNA against other tools?,CLOSED,2017-02-21T13:22:26Z,2017-02-22T11:37:45Z,2017-02-22T09:17:40Z,"Hello,
that is an interesting approach for the RNA inverse folding problem. Have you assessed the performance with MCTS against other tools such as antaRNA, Inv or MODENA? Or is this
going to be published in some form?

Best regards,
