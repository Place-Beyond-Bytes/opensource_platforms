I am trying to run the germline-filter tool but am unclear as to what the contents should be for the metadata csv file.

The message from the tools help page is somewhat vague on the requirements for each argument:

```
Usage: cerebra germline-filter [OPTIONS]

  filter out common SNPs/indels between germline samples and samples of
  interest

Options:
  --processes INTEGER
  --germline TEXT      [required]
  --cells TEXT         [required]
  --metadata TEXT      [required]
  --outdir TEXT        [required]
  -h, --help           Show this message and exit.
```

Please could the run instructions be updated to describe how to run the germline-filter tool with all the required files.

An example dataset would also be useful to demonstrate the required contents of the metadata csv.

Also then just to clarify I am assuming the germline and cells should be the VCF files for each?

These are all relatively standard requirements that many users will already have. It's good to see that users have the option of running this in Docker. Providing a [Nix expression](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/) is another option.

However, the documentation should be improved with an explanation of why these system packages are needed. They seem to be requirements for cerebra's dependencies rather than the package itself. This transparency is especially important if the dependencies-of-dependencies change in the future.

There are no installation instructions for Windows users, although there are is a large population of bioinformatics specialists who use Windows as their primary environment and might benefit from this software. I'm guessing this is because the package won't install on Windows due to the pysam dependency, but it should be explicitly stated.

The installation instructions for the package itself are not ideal. The primary method of installation (especially for research software with pinned requirements) should be a virtual environment. The primary installation method suggested is a system-level installation.

There are instructions for installing in a virtual environment via conda, but there is no reason I could see to require conda rather than using [standard library's venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). The virtual environment instructions also install the package in editable mode, which is ideal for development but not what most users would be expecting.

The installation section could be split into a ""for users"" section and a ""for developers"" section, where the latter describes an editable installation with test requirements and instructions for running unit tests locally.

MDU6SXNzdWU2NTgzMDIwMjg=,JoSS Review: Clarify README.md,CLOSED,2020-07-16T15:24:31Z,2020-08-18T20:56:35Z,2020-08-18T20:56:35Z,"With regard to the ongoing review for your [JoSS submission](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/2432), I would like to suggest stating some sort of use cases and/or warnings in your `README.md`. In particular, one of the largest drawbacks is the case of large VCF files. You even state as much in your [code](https://github.com/czbiohub/cerebra/blob/a6e4463fc6cff5b02583c8020cff09a288cbf598/cerebra/VCF.py#L61-L68):

>```python
> def dataframe(filename, large=True):
>     """""" [...]
>     Note: Using large=False with large VCF files. It will be painfully slow.
>     [...]
>     """"""
> ```

This same cannot be said about your instructions/quickstart.

VCFs can be excruciatingly large sometimes (looking at you 1KG/ENCODE). Many times, researchers want/need to summarize from this starting point. Therefore, suggesting something like _filtering_ the VCF based on region/contig _prior_ to running `cerebra` would be thoughtful suggestion to gung-ho users to preempt potentially long-running jobs.",betteridiot,https://github.com/czbiohub-sf/cerebra/issues/89
MDU6SXNzdWU2NTgzMzkwNTA=,JoSS Review: Quality of writing,CLOSED,2020-07-16T16:07:03Z,2020-09-15T23:07:50Z,2020-09-15T23:07:50Z,"With regard to the ""Quality of writing"" section for the ongoing review for your JoSS submission (https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/2432), these are my (very minor/nitpicky) remarks:

* ""wrangling"" is somewhat parlance and may be a difficult word to discern context from for international audiences
* I may be wrong here, but surnames should be written for both in-text and bibliographic citation. For groups of 6 or more, it is acceptable to use ""_et al_"" after the first author. This simplifies the citation so as to not break up the thought of the sentence any more than it already has.
* You are already use LaTex to write the paper, so it may be simpler to write 10^8 as <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=10^{8}""> instead
* (Question) What happens if a `*.fai` is already provided prior to `find-peptide-variants`? Will it construct a new one?
* It might be helpful to state in the caption of **Figure 3** that the first 10+ minutes appear to be the construction of the `genome interval tree` and can be considered overhead for the process, which runs approximately linearly thereafter (Ha! Just saw that you state the same thing just below)

for now failing due to `hgvs` dependency....there is no bioconda or conda-forge recipe for `hgvs`

all I could find in the way of conda builds was this https://anaconda.org/aroth85/hgvs

1. Why suggest users to install via `pip` in editable (`-e`) mode?
2. For your `pip` installations you could write the command as: `pip install [--user] .` to free up any global install concerns
3. You should preface the OS dependencies _prior_ to the package installation process. This might prevent users from getting towards the end of the install process and throwing up their hands in defeat.

MDU6SXNzdWU2ODEzMjcwODc=,JoSS Review: Functionality,CLOSED,2020-08-18T20:39:07Z,2020-09-03T15:21:32Z,2020-09-03T15:21:32Z,"With regard to the ongoing review for your [JoSS submission](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/2432), here are my notes/questions about the functionality of the package:

1. The hyperlink to [USAGE.md(https://github.com/czbiohub/cerebra/blob/master/docs/USAGE.md) within your [README.md](https://github.com/czbiohub/cerebra/blob/master/README.md) is not pointing to the correct place.
2. This might clear up my 3rd question: What does the `report_coverage` argument for `find-peptide-variants` do and why does it take an integer? If the argument is expecting a boolean, you can tell it to do so as such. If it has a range of options, those should be listed in the `-h` prompt.
3. If I used `1` for `report_coverage`, I got screen full of output that looked like `<class 'hgvs.edit.AASub'> <class 'hgvs.edit.AARefAlt'>`. This looks like somewhere in the code there is a `print()` on an object that does not have a representative `__repr__` or `__str__` methods. Therefore, to anyone that is not knee-deep in the code as a developer may be, this output means nothing to them. Consider defining those methods or making the output more meaningful.
4. What kind of file format is the output of `find-peptide-variants`? If it is a JSON (which I think you describe in the readme [section](https://github.com/czbiohub/cerebra#what-makes-cerebra-different-from-traditional-vcf-parsers)), maybe adding the `.json` suffix to the file path that the user supplies would be helpful. However, my `outfile` produced below does not seem to follow traditional JSON format (I see no brackets).

Below is my command history as detailed in your [README.md](https://github.com/czbiohub/cerebra/blob/master/README.md):
