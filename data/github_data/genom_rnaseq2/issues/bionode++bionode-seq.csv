I'll do a PR tonight...

MDU6SXNzdWUyMDk0NzA3NDk=,bionode-seq features as Atom.io plugin,OPEN,2017-02-22T14:32:43Z,2017-04-24T12:25:35Z,,"It would be useful to have some of the bionode-seq features in Atom for playing with DNA, RNA, AA sequences in much the same way as https://packagecontrol.io/packages/BioPythonUtils for Sublime Text.

I think some useful features would be: 
+ reverse complement selected DNA/RNA sequence
+ translate selected DNA/RNA sequence (using standard genetic code)
+ backtranslate AA sequence to DNA/RNA
+ sequence search that ignores newlines and space characters and optionally also looks for reverse complement
