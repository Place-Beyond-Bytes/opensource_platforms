MDU6SXNzdWUxOTM5Mzg1MzA=,Installation issue with R 3.3.0,CLOSED,2016-12-07T02:04:04Z,2016-12-07T03:04:19Z,2016-12-07T03:04:18Z,"When installing I get this issue:

ERROR: this R is version 3.3.0, package 'gcapc' requires R >= 3.4
Error: Command failed (1)

It is interesting because at the moment there is no official R 3.4 release.

I am getting this error for a given chip-seq bam file. I have removed duplicates from bam file. I have tried

bdw <- bindWidth(cov, range=c(50L,300L), step=10L)


Starting to estimate bdwidth.
...... Cycle 1 for bind width estimation
Error in seq.default(range[1], range[2], step) :
  'from' must be a finite number

Here is the summary of cov object

because it is hg38

Can you help me with this?",girdhar3,https://github.com/tengmx/gcapc/issues/3
I_kwDOBEDt486eQm1k,Missing value error,OPEN,2024-11-13T11:23:57Z,2024-11-13T11:23:57Z,,"I am trying to run the refineSites function in a count matrix of counts in peaks with 215 samples as columns. For the first 70 samples, the function runs fine. However, for the next samples, this error pops up: 
```
Error in while ((it <- it + 1) < limit && abs(del) > eps) { : 
  missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed
```
I have tried running the function in smaller counts matrix, but sometimes the error comes up and others don't. This is the command I am running:
`counts.list<-refineSites(counts=counts,sites=gr, emtrace = TRUE, plot = TRUE,genome=""hg38"")`

I was wondering if I am missing something or if you could help. Thank you
