it's not easy to compile the tools on my system---I didn't manage yet. To get rid of such portability issues, it would be great to move to autotools, such that one could compile and install on almost any system by configure&&make&&make install. Ian, do you have any experience with this? I could certainly help.",s-will,https://github.com/HosnaJabbari/CCJ/issues/2
