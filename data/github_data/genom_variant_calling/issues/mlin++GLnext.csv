I_kwDOGRwQgs6bEdud,Is it possible to use GLnext-*.jar on a computer without spark?,OPEN,2024-10-21T07:35:59Z,2024-10-21T07:35:59Z,,"Hi,

There are still a lot of computer/server without spark, is it possible to use GLnext-*.jar on a computer without spark?
The parallelizing or GLnexus is not so good, so hope there is a good parallelizing version of GLnexus.

Best,
