Thank you for this amazing resource on variant calling.

I am currently following this analysis and I have a query.

While executing trimmomatic, according to the below code, one has to provide two input files (E.g. file1_1.fastq, and file1_2.fastq) and the code will output four files (E,g. file1_1.trim.fastq, file1_1un.trim.fastq, file1_2.trim.fastq, and file1_2un.trim.fastq).
```
$ java -jar /usr/local/share/Trimmomatic-main/dist/jar/trimmomatic-0.40-rc1.jar PE SRR1972917_1.fastq.gz SRR1972917_2.fastq.gz SRR1972917_1.trim.fastq.gz SRR1972917_1un.trim.fastq.gz SRR1972917_2.trim.fastq.gz SRR1972917_2un.trim.fastq.gz SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 MINLEN:25 ILLUMINACLIP:NexteraPE-PE.fa:2:40:15
```

May I know the difference between file1_1.fastq (original input file), and the file1_1.un.trim.fastq. Additionally, how the latter file has originated?

Thank you for your time.

Best
