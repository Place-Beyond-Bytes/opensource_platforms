MDU6SXNzdWUzNjUxNzg0MjU=,Confirm that use of BLAST's `-max_target_seqs` is intentional,OPEN,2018-09-30T00:27:59Z,2018-09-30T00:27:59Z,,"Hi there,

This is a semi-automated message from a fellow bioinformatician. Through a GitHub search, I found that the following source files make use of BLAST's `-max_target_seqs` parameter: 

- [ComPar3](https://github.com/parasite-genomics/Pipelines/blob/9c5236da05e8e53a894eb911942df37458481e00/ComPar3)

Based on the recently published report, [Misunderstood parameter of NCBI BLAST impacts the correctness of bioinformatics workflows](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty833/5106166?redirectedFrom=fulltext), there is a strong chance that this parameter is misused in your repository.

If the use of this parameter was intentional, please feel free to ignore and close this issue but I would highly recommend to add a comment to your source code to notify others about this use case. If this is a duplicate issue, please accept my apologies for the redundancy as this simple automation is not smart enough to identify such issues.

Thank you!
