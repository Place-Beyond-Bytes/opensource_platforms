I_kwDOFldf4M5HEkPI,ReadPeaksFile.c Segmentation Fault Error,CLOSED,2022-04-04T22:27:04Z,2022-05-02T16:58:36Z,2022-05-02T16:58:36Z,"When running ""matchpeaks"" on BED files, a segmentation fault occurred in the ""ReadPeaksFile.c"" code without any further error message. It seems that the cause was that the ""MAXCHRS"" macro was too low to account for all the unique chromosome names in the BED file. Increasing this value and recompiling solved the issue. As the code already checks if the chromosome key is new, adding a count of unique chromosomes in each BED file when reading, and checking to see if the max is exceeded to produce an error message would make identifying this issue and its solution easier.",pql9132,https://github.com/eblancoga/seqcode/issues/3
I_kwDOFldf4M5ST-Va,issues on length parameter,OPEN,2022-09-21T13:48:56Z,2022-09-21T13:48:56Z,,"Hi there,

I am using the command-line produceGENEplots to plot ChIP-seq signal around some genes of interest.

I have noticed that when setting the ```length``` parameter to *X*, all the genes shorter than *X* are discarded from the analysis and the *X* nucleotides upstream the TSS and downstream the TTS are plotted.

I guess the ```length``` parameter is used to define the bins in which the genes are subdivided as well as the bins of the up and downstream intervals.

Let's say I would like to retain all the genes longer then *Y* and to plot the *Z* nucleotides up/downstream the genes. How can I do this?


Thanks.
Federico
