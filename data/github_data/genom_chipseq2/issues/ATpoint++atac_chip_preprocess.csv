- in samplesheet, allow a field ""exclude"" that if set the sample is not considered, e.g. when QC turns out to be bad one simply alters the samplesheet and uses `-resume` so the consensus peaks etc would be based on the good samples only

I_kwDOFydAr8532-mh,Question regarding filtering prior to peak calling,CLOSED,2023-11-26T05:40:00Z,2023-11-27T14:59:21Z,2023-11-27T08:09:36Z,"Hello @ATpoint , I hope this is a good place for me to ask a question regarding your pipeline.

In some ATAC-seq pipelines, fragments are size filtered (< 100 bp) to select for NFR, then fed into MACS2 for peak calling while some pipelines feed all the fragments.

I was wondering what your rationale was for not selecting for NFR (I tried to go through your source code, and please correct me if I am wrong).

Thanks! (and your help on biostars is always very helpful, thanks so much)",OrangeyO2,https://github.com/ATpoint/atac_chip_preprocess/issues/18
