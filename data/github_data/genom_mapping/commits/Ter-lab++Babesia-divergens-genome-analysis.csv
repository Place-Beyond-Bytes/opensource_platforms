This bash script features a robust script for quality assessment of sequencing reads, designed for genomic research and data analysis in projects such as the UK_Bdiv23B and 24B studies. The script ensures thorough quality checks and summary reporting for paired-end sequencing reads. You can also run this script to trim paired end reads from your project, just  change the path and run bash

Key Tools and Descriptions:

FastQC: Conducts comprehensive quality control checks on raw sequencing reads, providing detailed reports on read quality, GC content, sequence duplication, and more.

MultiQC: Aggregates FastQC reports into a single, user-friendly summary for streamlined result interpretation.

Features:

Straightforward command setup for read quality analysis using FastQC.

Automated loop for processing all paired-end FASTQ files in the specified directory.

Creation of an organized output directory for FastQC results.

Integration with MultiQC for generating consolidated quality summary reports.

Step-by-step script comments and instructions to facilitate reproducibility and ease of use.

This script supports efficient quality filtering and assessment, enhancing sequencing data reliability.",2024-11-13T11:35:37Z,Ter-lab

This repository provides a comprehensive pipeline for high-throughput sequencing analysis and genome assembly using various bioinformatics tools. The script includes detailed commands for performing read alignment, assembly, and quality assessment, tailored for research on genome assembly of Babesia divergens from UK cattle (Bos taurus) and related sequencing data.

Key Tools and Descriptions:

Bowtie2: Efficiently aligns short reads to reference genomes.

Samtools: Essential for handling and manipulating SAM/BAM files.

SPAdes: Assembles reads de novo for robust genome assembly.

SeqKit: Streamlines FASTA/Q file processing.

spray-and-pray.py: Identifies sequences using BLAST/DIAMOND databases.

QUAST: Evaluates genome assemblies and generates detailed reports.

Features:

Step-by-step command instructions, including SRA toolkit download, alignment, and extraction of unmapped reads.

Comprehensive guide for building Bowtie2 indices and downloading reference genomes from NCBI.

Detailed notes on trimming and naming conventions for sequencing reads (a seperate bash script for reads quality filtering is also provided).

This script facilitates streamlined genome analysis with clear, reproducible steps.",2024-11-13T11:25:34Z,Ter-lab
