1. When we remove a sequence we rescale to show the remainder, but when we add it back it can display offscreen and require a zoom out operation to become visible.

2. If we are zoomed in on a sequence region and we hide a sequence in another part of the view it can shift the view we are looking at, even though the region we were looking at hasn't changed.

Some things which would be nice to help with this.

1. Making it obvious when we are zoomed in rather than looking at the whole plot.

2. Having a separate mode for when we aren't zoomed in so that we always display everything

3. Changing how we store zoom conditions.  We could either store percentiles of the current view, or we could store anchor positions within specific sequences.

The fix will be to take the launcher and packaging code we developed for seqmonk and apply it to redotable and rebuild the binaries.  This will also mean that installation is simpler as we won't need the user to install java.  They'll still need to add full disk permissions manually, but there's no way around that without going through the app store.",s-andrews,https://github.com/s-andrews/redotable/issues/16

I have OpenJDK 14.0.2.12 installed in Windows 10, however when I try to start the .exe there is the error message that it can't find Java on my System. Other Java programs seem to work, do I need to set an additonal env variable or something? I have JAVA_HOME set. Or can I start redotable on the command line as a workaround?

I_kwDOCIfkqM56IRBP,Feature Request: Outputting Alignment Coordinates,OPEN,2023-12-19T16:15:02Z,2023-12-19T16:15:02Z,,"Dear Simon,

Thank you for developing this useful tool. I find it particularly valuable for visualizing alignments of highly repetitive sequences and their mutational patterns, such as those in centromeres. Given the challenges posed by the highly repetitive nature of such sequences, traditional alignment tools like minimap2, mummer, or the recently developed Unialigner may not perform optimally. However, the word-based alignment strategy employed by redotable appears to address this issue effectively.

While the current version of redotable lacks the ability to display specific coordinate positions of a diagonal line, I'm wondering if it's feasible to include a feature that allows the software to output alignment coordinates.

Best regards,
Xiao
