MDU6SXNzdWUxNjUwNjU4OQ==,Honor sequence-region pragmas when specified,CLOSED,2013-07-09T03:48:10Z,2013-07-11T13:46:26Z,2013-07-11T13:46:26Z,"[The GFF3 spec](http://sequenceontology.org/resources/gff3.html) discusses the utility of `##sequence-region` directives for bounds checking. Many GFF3 files do not provide these directives, but the `GtGFF3InStream` class conveniently infers theses boundaries from the annotations corresponding to each sequence.

However, it seems that when `##sequence-region` pragmas are provided, they are ignored or overridden by the `GtGFF3InStream` class. For example, I have a GFF3 file with the entry `##sequence-region   chr8 1 1000000` to indicate that the corresponding sequence is 100kb long. However, the right-most annotation in the file spans 88551-92176. When I parse these data with a `GtGFF3InStream` object, I get [1-92176] as the range, rather than [1-100000].

Being able to infer ranges from the annotations is no doubt a very useful feature, but when `##sequence-region` directives are explicitly provided, shouldn't these be honored and used?

- rename gt_jobs so it will be recognized as part of one of the classes in threads_api.h. It has to be moved on a line after the class is defined for that to work.
- move `gt_jobs` to `multithread_api` which is a module. This could be complicated, because the definition has to be moved to.
- by far the easiest way: add a comment line before the extern variable, with an Name and codeword module in it. This will add a module with only that variable to the documentation. I propose to name the module Thread like the file it resides in.

So if travis fails just on one test and this is not reproducible, this might be due to some random value, which is very hard to debug without the seed.

Here are some ideas to fix this:

testsuite.rb produces random number, outputs this number and uses this number as a seed for all tests in that run.

To pass the seed value to all the thousands of tests each calling gt multiple times one either has to change all the calls to gt in the testsuite and add -seed=X or we change the gt binary to check for an environmental variable GT_SEED. If defined it will use this. So the testsuite simple has to set that variable and no test-code has to be changed.
The gt-option -seed takes precedence over GT_SEED for those cases where a specific test has to use exactly one seedvalue and the testsuite only generates a random value if GT_SEED is not defined so it is possible to reproduce errors within the testsuite depending on random values.

How to we want to deal with this problem? We could reuse `GtUlong` (or introduce `GtUword`) in such a way that the `unsigned long` behaviour on Linux is mirrored on Windows for `GtUlong` and use `GtUlong` where appropriate.

Or we switch to types which always have a defined size, regardless of the machine.

It looks like you use Cairo to render, and the resulting SVGs are not a bit human readable, so I have no idea of the complexity here, but I also have no familiarity with Cairo. But mouseover and click events are built into the SVG spec, so maybe it's not impossible? Just a thought.

To fix this one would have to base every decision solely on what is in the adjacency matrices for the ontology DAG, using recursive search in the nodes only to extend the matrices. @gordon do you agree?

This is currently done by specifying `-usedesc` or `-matchdesc` options, or by tagging region IDs with MD5 hashes identifying the respective sequences, in which case the connection is made automagically. However, it is currently possible not to specify `-usedesc` or `-matchdesc` options as they are not mandatory. So in principle, it is possible to give a sequence file (or a GtEncseq, or a set of sequence files) with no hint about region mapping and no MD5 tagging. In this case, the first sequence in the set is (silently) taken as the source for all regions in the annotation. This can be very confusing and misleading if someone simply expects things to work (e.g. when using legacy LTRharvest output with 'seq0', 'seq1'... tags as input for the new LTRdigest which supports `-seqfile`, `-seqfiles`, and `-encseq`). All you eventually get is an error message if you try to access regions outside the sequence length. 
Is there any reason why this behaviour was there in the first place? I am fairly certain I did not implement it on purpose like this, but there were tests that expected it IIRC. I'd propose the following as a suggestion to make things more straightforward:
- Usually expect  `-usedesc` or `-matchdesc` as options if someone uses `-seqfile`, `-seqfiles`, and `-encseq` 
- If `-regionmapping` is used, use the entries in the mapping file to refer to the first sequence in the respective sequence files
- If none of these is given, try to use MD5 mapping or _fail_ when no MD5 is present!

In this case, users would not get unexpected results. Any comments or ideas?

For automated use, e.g. in a GFF/Git-based annotation tracking system, it might be convenient to have it output _all_ errors instead of only the first one. This functionality could, for example, be optional in the parser or input stream, so it may be activated in the validator tool but not in the other GtGFF3InStream-using tools. 
I see that is difficult to do because we try to ensure that everything that comes out of an input stream is guaranteed to be valid, and some errors simply cannot lead to valid annotation graphs. However, one might restrict this more relaxed error output to typically non-fatal errors in GFF3 input.

- Use a `GtFeatureOutStream` to capture the incoming stream of nodes into a `GtFeatureIndex` object.
- Process the nodes in the feature object and store the processed nodes in another `GtFeatureIndex` object.
- Use a `GtFeatureInStream` to deliver the processed nodes from this `GtFeatureIndex` to the next step in the node stream.

I'm having some issues with memory management. When I delete everything properly, I'm running into segfaults and core dumps. I can selectively omit deleting some node stream or feature index objects, but of course this introduces memory leaks that could be a big problem for large data sets.

I've tried to reduce all this to a simple example to wrap my mind around it. See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/standage/8717134). Note that running with valgrind, it will report no memory leaks (except the 5 libpixman cases), but lots of invalid reads. Comment out either line 87 or 89 and the invalid read messages go away, but memory leaks are introduced.

The spec also makes it clear that these methods can be combined.

> The two types of representations can be mixed, allowing large aligned segments to have their own GFF line and score, while small gaps within them are represented using a Gap attribute.

GFF3 produced by NCBI's annotwriter (part of the NCBI C++ toolkit) declares `match` and `cDNA_match` features as multifeatures, but utilizes line-specific `Gap` attributes to list small gaps in the alignment structure. GenomeTools complains about this, with an error message suggesting that multifeatures should have the same Gap attribute for each line. Unless I'm reading something incorrectly, this seems to violate cases explicitly allowed by the GFF3 spec.

Is fasta parsing hard coded everywhere it's needed in GenomeTools, or are there any reusable functions/data structures?

I propose to make this behaviour configurable in the parser, as http://www.sequenceontology.org/resources/converter_readme.html does.

- After parsing, the `GtAddIdsVisitor` will find that there is no sequence region with a trailing blank and add it. Now there are two sequence regions, one with and one without trailing blank.

This creates different files. Also, I wanted to run with the -dna option but it says :+1: error: superfluous argument ""–dna""
So I removed it.
Is it ok ?

Next, I did :

MDU6SXNzdWUzNDE4ODc2Mg==,-matchdesc and multiple occurrences of IDs in headers,CLOSED,2014-05-23T16:04:40Z,2014-05-29T12:32:38Z,2014-05-29T12:32:38Z,"The `-matchdesc` option causes confusion when a query seqid could match more than sequence in a set. For example, in _D. melanogaster_, there are heterochromatin sequences intermingled with the euchromatin sequences:

```
$ zgrep '>' dmel-all-chromosome-r5.57.fasta.gz | cut -f 1 -d' '
>YHet
>2RHet
>2LHet
>3LHet
>3RHet
>U
>XHet
>dmel_mitochondrion_genome
>2L
>X
>3L
>4
>2R
>3R
>Uextra
```

So using, for example, `-matchdesc` with a sequence ID of `2L` will return `2LHet` as the corresponding sequence as `2LHet` is the first sequence in the set whose description contains `2L`. But it is not the correct one ('2L' coming later in the set). That makes the `-matchdesc` quite unintuitive to use. Moreover, there is AFAICS no other way to find sequences by header matching in a multi-sequence input.
I propose to add another matching option, for instance called `-matchdescstart`, which will behave like many other sequence processing tools do: it will try to match the given sequence ID  _exactly_ against the prefix of each sequence description up to the first whitespace. This way, a one-to-one mapping is obtained and ambiguous results like above should not occur.
I also propose to emit a warning (or even error?) if a `-matchdesc` seqid query matches multiple sequence descriptions so the caller gets notified of this.

Any other suggestions about how to approach this issue?

This is OK for internal CDSs as the DNA parts are concatenated and translated as a whole. However, if the first CDS (in reading direction) in a protein coding transcript has a phase different from zero, the resulting protein products are broken in the current implementation as the necessary amount of bases is not skipped from the beginning of the concatenated sequence while translating.

I am aware of the fact that this can be 'fixed' by forcing a phase of 0 for the first CDS and adjusting the start position of the CDS in this case, but I am currently facing a set of partial gene annotations, a substantial number of which are annotated in this way and I do not want to mess with the gene models.

Unfortunately, there are some tools (Tabix, I'm looking at you!) which expect GFF3 output sorted on a individual line basis.  From this point of view, the example above would not be sorted (the polypeptide starts after the last CDS)!

I propose to implement an alternative output stream for annotation graphs, which would output `###` separated blocks not only on the basis of graph connectivity, but also consider overlapping features and place them within the same block, resulting in an output format like the following:

Generally, when there's many sequences with few annotations each the sequence access takes very long. I propose to implement `-matchdescstart` separately by preprocessing the relevant part of the sequence headers into a hash table when the sequence set is loaded for the first time, allowing to do the mapping in constant time afterwards. 
For `-matchdesc` there is not much one can do as the match positions are unconstrained.

One has to adapt the `package.path` global variable with the exact directory to search for the file to load.

I propose to add a new field to the global `gt` table, say `gt.script_dir`, containing the directory the current script is located in (based on the path used for calling it). If there was no path, i.e. the script is in the current working directory, `gt.script_path` should be `.`.

However, the failure was silent, and even though it was followed directly by a assertion error (`src/annotationsketch/graphics_cairo.c:129`) it still took me some time to isolate the issue.

With a bit of experimentation I found that `cairo_image_surface_create` gives up somewhere between 30000 and 40000 pixels. The exact value may be documented somewhere, but I didn't find it with a quick search. Regardless, this is way above what is expected for typical usage. I ended up using 10000px as the upper bound for ParsEval.

Perhaps we should drop a warning message to stderr whenever the width is above some threshold (e.g., 10000) indicating that if something fails it's probably due to a width issue?

However, the updates abandoned some of the nice features of `ctypes` that did not seem to work correctly on OS X. See #211.

I opened up [a bug report](http://bugs.python.org/issue22945) with the Python folks, and their reply pointed out something that we had missed. See eryksun's message: essentially, we need to do an additional conversion/dereference for pointers to C objects.

``` c
// Old way: problems on OS X
self._as_parameter_ = self.g

// New way: no problems
self._as_parameter_ = c_void_p(self.g)
```

I confirmed that this fix worked for my dummy C library example, so I don't see any reason it shouldn't work for the GenomeTools python bindings. I would much rather use `ctypes` idiomatically than go through and do the type/error checking that seemed inevitable from working with pointers directly.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format says:

""The original Sanger FASTQ files also allowed the sequence and quality strings to be wrapped (split over multiple lines), but this is generally discouraged as it can make parsing complicated due to the unfortunate choice of ""@"" and ""+"" as markers (these characters can also occur in the quality string).""

That's what the original file looks like:

Is there a specific reason for this behaviour? I can imagine this could have to do with no parent element to attach the inter-features to, but I would expect them to be emitted as top-level features of their own.

Also, the `gt interfeat` tool should probably be able to also emit the region between the first/last item of the outside type and the start/end of the sequence region containing the feature.

extractfeat tries to pick reference sequences using MD5 tag by default. To look up by id, `-matchdescstart` option must be used.

I am not sure if it's common to refer to ref seqs by their MD5 in GFF files. I think mapping by seqid is more common. And `-matchdescstart` option is not intuitive - even after reading the docs it's not clear that this is the option one is looking for. I resorted to trial and error to pick b/w `-matchdesc`, `-usedesc`, and `-matchdescstart`.

I suggest setting `-matchdescstart` the default, or removing the option altogether if gt can intelligently decide whether to use MD5 or seqid (so as to not break the current behavior).

If I lower the similarity threshold, to the default for example, then I get this error with LTRdigest.

I am trying to get LTRHarvest and LTRDigest to work on my computer and I figured I'd try an easy small scale test first just to see what the outputs actually look like and if I can manage it since I have pretty much no bio informatics background.

I chose a small file with 3 25kb locuses from the dog genome that I know to contain an almost complete provirus each. However every time I try to start suffixerator as described in the LTRHarvest manual, it tells me my sequence is empty.

My fasta sequences are in a text file ending in .fas as your exemple file does (even though I'm not sure the file extension is important) and follow the format : 

.>sequence_name
_sequence in caps A,T,G,C_
.>sequence2_name
_sequence2 in caps A,T,G,C_
etc...

(Without the . in front of the >, just put it there to avoid GitHub's formatting)

Why does suffixerator think my sequences are empty ?

We have a GFF3 file containing repeats. They do not have 'ID' fields, as we do not have unique ids, but they have 'description' fields.
For some of those, the description is a string 'ID'.
As far as I am aware, none of this is against GFF3 specifications.
When running gt gff3 with the -retainids option however, the 'ID' description is picked up as an 'ID' with no value and added to the start of the attributes fields.
Is this meant to be or could it be updated to only use 'ID' if it is before the '='?

I've been trying to run 'gt ltrdigest' on a compute farm. I found that if I run one LTRdigest job on the farm, it runs fine, but if I submit lots of LTRdigest jobs at once (all using the same -hmms directory of HMM files), then I get errors and the jobs die, with errors relating to the HMM files. 
I then tried setting the TMPDIR environment variable to be a different local directory for each LTRdigest job, and was able to run lots of jobs at once on our compute farm. All the jobs seemed to finish fine, and at first I thought this had solved the problem.
However, I noticed that the output gff from LTRdigest didn't have any 'protein_match' features when I ran lots of jobs at once on the compute farm (while if I just ran one job on the farm at a time, the output gff did have 'protein_match' features). I'm not sure why this is, because the *fas files for the protein domains are produced fine. However, I think it must be that somehow the hmmer search didn't run ok?
Please let me know if you'd like me to send more info or files.

Are there really widespread issues with memory management that are pervasive across different Linux distributions? Or are these false positives?

Either way, I've tried creating suppressions files (they're massive and I don't have time to manually inspect them) but it never seems to be a comprehensive solution.

The problem seems to be that the SYSTEM=Windows environment variable is not passed through to   `scripts/travis_test.rb`. I'm wondering if `env = {}` in the scripts resets the complete environment. But if it does, that it is weird that the tests with `cairo=no` build correctly.

As mentioned earlier, I sometimes encounter these and they usually break any downstream processing by just throwing a parse error. It would be useful to have the stream continue in tidy mode, try to recover a sensible resulting graph and just emit a warning.
My first idea was to just drop these from the stream, e.g. as in https://github.com/satta/genometools/commit/534146c719d2bd71e93b6ae323bf998c529ea839 -- any ideas or other suggestions?

I have a bit of a problem with gt gff3, I wanted to check if I have duplicate gene ids in my file, but the flag seems not to be working.

After gt gff3 -sort yes -retainids yes -checkids yes test.gff3 > gt.out.gff3

[gt.out.gff3.txt](https://github.com/genometools/genometools/files/42371/gt.out.gff3.txt)
[test.gff3.txt](https://github.com/genometools/genometools/files/42372/test.gff3.txt)

There is no warning about duplicate gene ids although they are present. The duplicate gene gets grouped with the first gene.  I tested v1.5.7 and v.1.5.4
Is that expected behavior? It seems counter-intuitive.

I also have a historical question. I was trying to re-run some analysis from 2012. Back then I used v.1.3.5 and I used to get warnings:
warning: feature ID ""BOLE_PAN00005191.1:cds"" not unique: changing to BOLE_PAN00005191.1:cds.1

But what I did not notice is that for some genes the ids got changed and for the others not.

So I ended up with a mosaic file which looked like this: 
[historical.mosaic.gff3.txt](https://github.com/genometools/genometools/files/42373/historical.mosaic.gff3.txt)

Any idea what could have caused that back then? It seems bizarre. It is important 
for my re-analysis as I am trying to understand if it was a strange gff3 file or unexpected 
program behavior. Again no errors.

Best wishes,
Agnieszka

I would expect the two RVT_1 matches in this element to be chained together.

Is there a reason why they are split?

I analysis the LTR  chromosome by chromosome using LTRharvest and LTRdigest. If there are 5 chromosomes,  I would get 5 gff3 files finally. Then I want use LTRsift to help me filter  candidate sequence. but I also need to analysis chromosome by chromosome because LTRsift only allow select one associated indexname but there are 5 indexnames in fact. If  I do this one chromosome by chromosome, it will influence the classification. For example, A candidate in Chr1 would be the same family with B candidate in Chr2. so, how could I make those 5 index files into 1 index files?

I  combined the 5 chromsomes sequence files to 1 file and tried to only produce one gff3 file and index file through LTRhavest. Howerver, the analysis was out of memory of computer. I cannot image what happen if I merge 20 chromsomes sequence files into 1 file.

I have read the papaer you published about LTRsift, there were two analysis about the fly and mouse and there are also more than one chromosome in every part, how did you solve the problem? Thanks

The attached scripts download the genome and annotations, and extract exonic, coding and protein sequences corresponding to the annotations, as an example. `process_with_gt` in `extractfeat.rb` captures a workaround for sorting the GFF3 multiple times.

```

So what I am pretty sure is going on here is that since the CDS pieces are not in linear order along the Mitochondria plasmid, your tool is reordering them to be that way.
Here is that order:

```

```

However, for transplicing this is the wrong behavior.
If the rows are taken as seen in the file, the phase is correct.
If the rows are reordered then it would expect the segment from 190740 to 190761 to have a phase of 2.

See attached excel sheet.

Here is the Genbank version of the CDS.  The order in the GFF matches the GenBank coordinates given.

Couple of potential suggestions on how to handle.
1) If ""trans-splicing"" or ""trans-spliced"" and do not reorder
2) Check the phase, but allow it to be warning or a stricter checking option.

@stefan-kurtz Can I revert the commit? The `GtBioseq` was always about automatically creating the corresponding indices and I think in that case it make more sense to have them in the same directory as the original sequence files (and it's the behaviour we had so far). Or did I miss anything? I see the reason for consistency with the other tools, but it breaks some tools and would require some work in them and might cause problems for existing users.

MDU6SXNzdWUxNTMwOTU4Mjc=,Possible error in phase calculation when a CDS segment is 1bp long,CLOSED,2016-05-04T19:32:08Z,2016-07-02T13:02:16Z,2016-07-02T13:02:16Z,"# It seems that GenomeTools is treating 1bp CDS exons in the wrong way when calculating the phase, by considering them as length 2 instead of 1.

Prologue: to calculate phases in a tool I am working on, I am using the following function:

```
def __calculate_phases(coding, previous):

    # Previous indicates whether the record began with a phase different from 0
    # for incomplete gene models
    total_cds_length = -previous

    __calculated_phases = []
    for cds_segment in coding:
        length = cds_segment[1][1] - cds_segment[1][0] + 1
        phase = (3 - (total_cds_length % 3)) % 3
        total_cds_length += length

    return total_cds_length, __calculated_phases

I am not sure it is correct as I have not been able to find the relevant corresponding section in the GenomeTools codebase. 

In my case, I have the following GFF entry:

The gt gff3 tool (latest release, version 1.5.8, linux x86_64 binaries) complains that the phase is incorrect for this entry, with the following error:

```
warning: CDS feature on line 19 in file ""stdin"" has the wrong phase 1 -> correcting it to 0
warning: CDS feature on line 17 in file ""stdin"" has the wrong phase 0 -> correcting it to 2
warning: CDS feature on line 15 in file ""stdin"" has the wrong phase 2 -> correcting it to 1

warning: CDS feature on line 7 in file ""stdin"" has the wrong phase 1 -> correcting it to 0
warning: CDS feature on line 6 in file ""stdin"" has the wrong phase 0 -> correcting it to 2
```

The complaints begin after line 21, ie an exon/CDS line with length 1 (45276 .. 45276). 
This seems wrong to me, for the following reasons:

1- If I have understood the method of calculation right, the phase should be calculated by taking the modulo 3 of the amount of sequence already met before encountering the current CDS segment; see the code at the beginning of the issue report.

   My function agrees with the phases present in the input GFF record I pasted in the comment, but not with GenomeTools; it reports the total CDS length as being 1788 ie a number divisible by 3.

2 - I can obtain the same results as GenomeTools in terms of phases by adding 2 instead of 1 to the total_cds_length variable when encountering the 1-bp exon:

```
def __calculate_phases(coding, previous):
    # Previous indicates whether the record began with a phase different from 0
    # for incomplete gene models

    total_cds_length = -previous

    __calculated_phases = []
    for cds_segment in coding:
        length = cds_segment[1][1] - cds_segment[1][0] + 1
        # This agrees with GenomeTools
        if length == 1:
             length += 1
        phase = (3 - (total_cds_length % 3)) % 3
        total_cds_length += length
        __calculated_phases.append(phase)

    return total_cds_length, __calculated_phases
```

The result in this case will agree with GenomeTools regarding the phases, _but the total CDS length will be incorrect (1789, and 1789 % 3 == 1)_. This seems quite wrong.

I think I saw repfind errors fail a few times and looking at the code of the test I am not sure why they would fail only sometimes. Probably race conditions, but it was the grep that failed and the file it was supposed to process was touched before, so it existed.
Also, the tests in gt_repfind_include around lines 200ff are repeated 3 times without a visible reason?
Could someone who has worked on that code have a look? Maybe they understand where there could be a problem with parallel test execution.

MDU6SXNzdWUxNjQzMTU0MTA=,mkindex on both strands?,CLOSED,2016-07-07T13:58:31Z,2016-07-08T09:54:37Z,2016-07-08T09:54:37Z,"Hi,

I am trying to use the mkindex program to find all 20-mers with a minimal occurrence (10 in my example) but I need the program to check both strands of my sequences. I don't know if this is possible but I found the -mirrored option in the suffixerator program. When I use this option to construct the esa, I get an error message when I run mkindex. Is this a bug or is it simply not possible to search on both strands?

These commands work:

```
gt suffixerator -dna -pl -tis -suf -lcp -v -db seqs.fas -indexname seqs
gt tallymer mkindex -minocc 10 -mersize 20 -esa seqs
```

These commands give me an error:

```
gt suffixerator -dna -pl -tis -suf -lcp -mirrored -v -db seqs.fas -indexname mirrored
gt tallymer mkindex -minocc 10 -mersize 20 -esa mirrored
```

error message:

```
gt tallymer mkindex -minocc 10 -mersize 20 -esa mirrored
Assertion failed: (len >= 1UL && encseq != NULL && startpos + len <= encseq->totallength), function gt_encseq_contains_special, file src/core/encseq.c, line 696.

I had a question on the ""GT CDS"" command. I would like to add the CDS feature to my Gff3 file, that has exons in it. I saw that genometools can do this for you.

gt cds -startcodon -finalstopcodon -seqfile foo.fasta -o foo.gff3 [GFF3-FILE]

1) I am looking for the CDS to be the longest ORF with an ATG start codon per mRNA. Do the gff3 coordinates in the output reflect that? 

2) It is possible that a single mRNA will give rise to two CDS of equal size but with different start and stops. In case of such conflicts, what does gt cds do?

3) I did not see a flag for specifying the genetic code. Is this by default ""standard vertebrate""?

I have a multifasta file with examplars LTR elements obtained using LTR-harvest and LTR-digest follwing the ""Repeat Library Construction-Advanced"" pipeline.

http://weatherby.genetics.utah.edu/MAKER/wiki/index.php/Repeat_Library_Construction-Advanced

I'd like to annotate these fasta LTR elements using the pHMM search option of LTR-digest.
I have installed genometools-1.5.10 including the pHMM search option.

$ make with-hmmer=yes threads=yes cairo=no
$ make install cairo=no prefix=/home/data/genometools-1.5.10/bin

I downloaded all the HMMs from GyDB and converted them in HMMER3.
I created the suffix for my multifasta file:

$ gt suffixerator -tis -des -dna -ssp -db MyLTR.fasta -indexname MyLTR

Finally, I have launched the following command line:

$ gt -j 10 ltrdigest -hmms GyDB/*.hmm -- MyLTR > ltrdigest

The process is running with less than 1 CPU and the output never updates.

Did I miss something in the command line that stuck the process? Or is there something in general that I am missing?

Thank you for any advice",uceleste,https://github.com/genometools/genometools/issues/887

## Problem Definition
I need to extract intron sequences. So when I use these coords, I get the same intron DNA sequence thrice. This happens for several intron regions. How do I extract sequences without redundancy? i.e. the combination of fasta header and sequence should appear just once? Currently I am using gt generated GFF3 file in combination with bedtools getfasta to extract DNA sequences with GFF3+Genome fasta files as inputs

using `gt --version` prints besides other information `gt (GenomeTools) 1.5.11` (with the current master).
The last Release was 1.5.10 so there is not really a 1.5.11 and, if one has to handle different compiles of gt, all are the same version unless one is older than a recent release.

If one now uses `git describe --tags` on the current master one gets: `v1.5.10-19-g161fb4c21` - which is much more helpful in my eyes. It contains the version, the number of commits following the release-tag and even the hash of HEAD.

The only Problem I see with this: if one compiles the source from a download other than git, this information would not be present. But it could be included in the VERSION file as a fallback for our releases on GitHub?

nevertheless I question the policy of printing a version number that is not released yet.

I  want to discover TIR (Terminal Inverted Repeat) elements with gt tirvish. I ran the command as I show you next (without problems). Then I want to filter the output by protein motif as it can be done with the ltrharvest/ltrdigest, but the output was 0 TIRs. I did it wiht the gt select using the .lua files.

Recently, when I was running LTR_harvest, an issue comes up and I have no idea what it means and how to solve this problem.

The genometools was installed by conda 
`conda install -c bioconda genometools-genometools`

The index was generated by following the manual:
`gt suffixerator -db etuer.test.fasta -indexname etuer -tis -suf -lcp -des -ssp -sds -dna`

Then I tried to run LTR_harvest by using the command:
`gt ltrharvest -index etuer -minlenltr 100 -maxlenltr 7000 -mintsd 4 -maxtsd 6 -motif TGCA -motifmis 1 -similar 85 -vic 10 -seed 20 -seqids yes`

However, the software gave a message and ended:
`cannot flock: Function not implemented`

What does this mean? Is there something wrong with the installation or the software setup?
Thanks in advance!

If file locking isn't available the process shouldn't hang.  It should die early ( should locking be absolutely necessary ) or timeout after a reasonable amount of time.  This holds up pipelines when a user inadvertently runs on an unsupported filesystem.

It would be helpful if when adding introns to a gff3 it would also add ID's instead of just Parent's. Similar to how exons and cds's have ID's associated with their parent.

I am using the `-retainids -addintrons` flags.

Currently, the results look like:

```

I am running LTR harvest on a 2.7 Gb genome. It gives a segmentation fault and fails repeatedly on multiple machines. RAM is not the issue as I have tried reserving up to 300 GB for this job. Even though the result is only a segmentation fault, it takes 72 hours to run. This is the exact error:

This is both a question and a crash report:

I have been given a series GFF files that have issues with children coordinates (I don't control the annotation source).  Specifically in some genes, some of the exon children happen to overlap (no intron and children have a slight overlap).   From what I see in the code I am not allowed to alter a previously parsed child node's coordinates, but rather to make a new one with the correct coordinates and hopefully delete the problematic child node (the one originally parsed from the file)

There is a gt-python function that implements the C functionality in ""gtlib.gt_feature_node_add_child"" for adding newly created child nodes to a parent feature tree.   However I haven't found a corresponding python method for deleting a node (C code has gt_genome_node_delete or gt_feature_node_remove_leaf)

Have I missed it in the gt-python code? What is the proper way to do this? or maybe is not implemented yet?  

So instead I attempted to make calls to the C methods directly like this in my python script:

```
    from gt.dlload import gtlib
    ...
    gtlib.gt_feature_node_remove_leaf(feature, tfn)  # where tfn is the current child node iterated with FeatureNodeIteratorDirect()

```
Having the last line in my python code that is iterating over feature trees in a FeatureIndexMemory index causes the script to crash with a segmentation fault but no further message. 

Is this a bug or simply the wrong way to go about this?


## What GenomeTools version are you reporting an issue for (as output by `gt -version`)?
Multiple versions from 1.5 up to current one (version 1.6.1)

## Did you compile GenomeTools from source? If so, please state the `make` parameters used.
No.  I downloaded precompiled binaries and libraries from two separate places (Bioconda, Ubuntu packages) and both had same behaviour on multiple versions.  I tryed the Bioconda solution on two distributions (Ubuntu and CentOS)

## What operating system (e.g. Ubuntu, Mac OS X), OS version (e.g. 15.10, 10.11) and platform (e.g. x86_64) are you using?
Ubuntu 20.04  and CentOS 7 on x86_64,  both using python3.6 or above

Travis-CI.org is shutting down and we would need to migrate our CI to Travis-CI.com (https://blog.travis-ci.com/2021-05-07-orgshutdown).
Regarding Travis, we have seen that macOS builds take too long because there are no binary packages for the dependencies for the OS version they are running, so they need to be built from source, which exceeds their time limit for runs.

I am wondering whether we might want to migrate the CI to GitHub Actions completely, which appears to be as a well-integrated, feature-rich solution, which will hopefully be supported for a long time. This would also remove dependencies to external services even more.

Any comments? Alternatively we could just move the CI to Travis-CI.com as described and just remove the macOS tests.",satta,https://github.com/genometools/genometools/issues/973

Dear @satta : 

Using Python3, when creating a GFF FeatureNode from scratch,  setting its ""source"" field with fn.set_source() method results in the storage of a string that is possibly twice encoded.

If the user requests the source data back with fn.get_source() method, what the user gets back is a proper string that falsely resembles a ""bytes"" object.   Attempting to decode the object results in an attribute error because the object does not have a ""decode"" attribute.   

The object is already a string,  but it retains (as a string) the format  b'text'  which looks like a bytes object. (See code below)

I assume the source logic is attempting to be transparent to both python2 and python3.  I did not test with python2.

## example python3.8 code ""test_newfeat_source.py"" follows
```python
#!/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

from gt.extended.feature_node import FeatureNodeIteratorDirect
from gt.dlload import gtlib
from gt.extended import *
import sys
import re
print(sys.path)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    seqid = ""foo""
    seqsource = ""BAR""
    gene = FeatureNode.create_new(seqid, ""gene"", 100, 900, ""+"")
    gene.set_source(  seqsource   )
    exon1 = FeatureNode.create_new(seqid, ""exon"", 100, 200, ""+"")
    exon1.set_source(  seqsource   )
    gene.add_child(exon1)
    exon2 = FeatureNode.create_new(seqid, ""exon"", 800, 900, ""+"")
    exon2.set_source(  seqsource   )
    gene.add_child(exon2)

    fin = FeatureNodeIteratorDepthFirst(gene)
    while True:
        fn = fin.next()
        if not fn:
            break
        tfn_source = fn.get_source().decode('UTF-8')
        print(fn, tfn_source, fn.get_type())

    print(""\n..After reformating source gff3 field..."")
    locregex=re.compile(""b'(.+)'$"")
    fin = FeatureNodeIteratorDepthFirst(gene)
    while True:
        fn = fin.next()
        if not fn:
            break
        tfn_source = fn.get_source().decode('UTF-8')
        #tfn_source = str(fn.get_source())
        if (tfn_source.startswith(""b'"")):
            locpatternsearch = locregex.search(tfn_source)
            tfn_source = locpatternsearch.group(1)               #         <=== FIXed here
        print(f'The type of obj ""source"" is {type(tfn_source)}')

Dear @satta : 

I use GenomeTools python library to fix or modify GFF files provided by external collaborators when these don't match the spec or don't fit our internal systems.   Many times this involves issues with coordinate systems (coordinate translation for just a region of a chromosome or some major re-arrangement) or fixing other items in the object (attributes, intron/exon boundaries, etc).

Sometimes, it would be simpler to modify an existing FeatureNode object in place rather than to make a a new one to copy most of the old node's attributes and fix the one attribute or coordinates that need fixing from ""failed"" object.

It would be nice to do something like this to the existing FeatureNode class (or one that inherits from it):  

```python
#... as part of class definition ...
def update_range(self, this_start, this_end):
    newrange = Range( this_start, this_end )
    try:
        print(f""Setting range of to : {newrange}"")
        gtlib.gt_genome_node_set_range(self.gn, newrange)
    except:
        raise Exception(""Unable to update the range"")
```

But the code above fails because ""newrange"" is not the C GtRange object expected..  I am not sure what I should be passing from the Python side.   And actually it would be lovely if the python FeatureNode class would support this.

Another nice to have method  would be if the python existing FN.add_attribute()  method (or  a new one)  used the C library  [gtlib.gt_feature_node_set_attribute()](https://github.com/genometools/genometools/blob/694fe366e92d56d2b70ec7ef5742a75560e9a992/src/extended/feature_node.c#L683)   (which allows override of existing attribute) instead of [gtlib.gt_feature_node_add_attribute](https://github.com/genometools/genometools/blob/694fe366e92d56d2b70ec7ef5742a75560e9a992/gtpython/gt/extended/feature_node.py#L157) (expects attribute to be brand new)

I will be happy to submit pull requests, but need to get familiar with the process first.

Cheers,

Mauricio L.

An error occurs when issuing the sort command on my gff3 file. It seems like the gt program is classifying a single feature as a multi-feature, which leads to an error. The error is copied below: 

**gt gff3: error: the multi-feature with ID ""None"" on line 1911 in file ""input.gff3"" has a different attribute 'Parent' than its counterpart on line 1904 ('mRNA37983' vs. 'mRNA37984')**

I am fairly certain that the ID=""None"" for the CDS is causing this problem. Please let me know if there is a way within gt to circumvent this issue or if you have a suggestion for manually fixing this naming problem (if you agree that this is the cause of the error).

## Problem description
I’m running LTR harvest/digest and I faced some issues. 
I have over 200 species so I wanted to run several species at once. To do so I wrote a bash function to use with gnu parallel that allows to run several jobs at the same time. When I checked this morning I realised I had a lot of errors like these:

```
Error: File format problem, trying to open HMM file /tmp/198a084286222afb27419fcb9d8e6170.
Opened /tmp/198a084286222afb27419fcb9d8e6170.h3m, a pressed HMM file; but format of its .h3i file unrecognized

gt ltrdigest: error: HMMER child process terminated with error

Error: Unexpected error 7 in opening hmm file /tmp/198a084286222afb27419fcb9d8e6170.

```

I tried to run one species individually and it runs smoothly and found more data than my first parallel run. I tried again with 2 species running at the same time and got the “Unexpected error 7 in opening hmm file” again for one of the chromosomes. My thought is I can’t run LTRharvest/digest on several species at the same time. Is there a way around that?

I think it's this one?

`-Werror` is enabled by default. You shouldn't cause issues for users that use a compiler that detects other things than you.
They are warnings by default for a reason, and while I sympathize that you try to have a code without warnings, it is unreasonable to expect compilers not to add new warnings.


## Exact command line call triggering the problem
```
make

## Example minimal input triggering the problem
Running any fedora, even the oldest supported one, has a to recent compiler to not detect potential errors in the code.

Debian testing has apparently introduced a new compiler version that does new static checks, causing builds to fail due to warnings: https://github.com/genometools/genometools/actions/runs/6418106818/job/17425238068

We need to address those by fixing them in the code. Users should not be impacted since we now skip these warnings by default instead of making them errors.
