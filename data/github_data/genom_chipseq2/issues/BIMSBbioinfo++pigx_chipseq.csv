So we could either think about checking for this on our own or we should think about using the hub_check utility from UCSC to test wether the current track hub configuration works, see here (https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/hgTrackHubHelp.html#Debug).

There are multiple ways to tackle this with the tool: 
First
 - wait until most of the steps are done and then print a warning (not the best option)
 - do a dry-run for the hub-creation in a sub directory, where every necessary file is touched (like touching make_ucsc_hub.input files) (my favorite)
Then use the hub_check utility. 

The benefit of checking on our own is clearly that we don't need further dependencies and we can check for this already during the validation step in the driver script.

A solution to this issue could be that we use the custom params to overwrite the default general settings (i.e. config dict) on a per sample basis, such that we do not have to deal with two dictionaries to handle settings.

use the following general structure.

# Introduction
Example: PiGx RNA-seq is a preprocessing and analysis pipeline. It takes single-end or paired-end fastq files containing fragment reads, and does all the necessary preprocessing to get analysis-ready gene expression levels. It also performs quality control steps and outputs comprehensive quality statistics. Finally, it performs a differential expression analysis and outputs a stand-alone HTML report with tables and figures summarizing any differential gene expression between samples as specified in the experiment design.

## workflow
Describe the main workflow steps in bullet points, put the workflow picture

## output
Describe the output in bullet points. Example:
- QC reports
- bam files
- bigwig files
- narrowPeak files
- UCSC track hub folder

# Installation
Show users how to install it. If you want to list dependencies etc, this is the place. If you want to show how to install via conda this is the place. You can have extra subsections if you need.

# Quick Start [This should be done asap if possible ]
put the test data somewhere online, show users how to download it and run it

# Preparing the input
Here we describe how to prepare the sample sheet and the settings file
## sample sheet
- [Describe what is in the sample sheet in detail, show an example, explain columns]
- [ show how to initialize settings file via --init=sample-sheet]

## settings file
- [Describe what is in the settings file in detail, show an example if possible ]
- [ show how to initialize settings file via --init=settings]


# Running the pipeline
Describe how to run the pipeline. Describe additional arguments here if you need to. Such as 
  --target -n, --dry-run, --unlock etc.
You can explain a couple important ones and direct users to use help for the rest. subsections such as ""resource consideration"" etc can go here.
If there are differences for running on the cluster or locally these should go here. See RNA-seq documentation for such a description

# Output description
Describe what pipeline outputs and if there is specific directory structure describe it here.
There can be subsections here such as ""Downstream analysis"" if need be

# Troubleshooting/FAQ
List potential issues and solutions here

# Questions

yes, but if user sets `hs` or `mm` as value, then it will always be the same …

this is my first time trying to run pigz and touching guix, so I will try to go by the documentation and put my questions here so we can improve the documentation.

# Installation
After `guix package -i pigx-chipseq` and putting guix in my PATH as proposed by guix (`export PATH=""/home/cmessers/.guix-profile/bin${PATH:+:}$PATH""`), do I need to run `guix environment -l guix.scm`? Apparently the last command generates an environment for development, but to use the pipeline it does not appear to be necessary.


# command name?

In my installation, the command appears to be `pigx-chipseq` and not `pigx chipseq` as the docs say.

# Replicates

The docs say
> The current sample sheet does not support multiple technical replicates for one sample, so replicates need to be combined prior to running the pipeline.

i get that this is a limitation of MACS2. How should biological replicates be handled?

Further, I was confused by the sample sheet regarding this same point.

The example includes

```
    Peaks4:
        ChIP:
            # multiple samples can be used as treatment
            - ChIP1
            - ChIP2
        Cont:
            # multiple samples can be used as control
            - Cont1
            - Cont2
```

So how are ChIP1 and ChIP2 handled here?

Otherwise the running the tests went fine.

Thanks for the effort,
Clemens

> - Experiments should have two or more biological replicates. Assays performed using EN-TEx samples may be exempted due to limited availability of experimental material, but at least two technical replicates are required. 
> - Each replicate should have 25 million non-duplicate, non-mitochondrial aligned reads for single-end sequencing and 50 million for paired-ended sequencing (i.e. 25 million fragments, regardless of sequencing run type). 
> - The alignment rate, or percentage of mapped reads, should be greater than 95%, though values >80% may be acceptable. 
> - Replicate concordance is measured by calculating IDR values (Irreproducible Discovery Rate). The experiment passes if both rescue and self consistency ratios are less than 2.
> - Library complexity is measured using the Non-Redundant Fraction (NRF) and PCR Bottlenecking Coefficients 1 and 2, or PBC1 and PBC2. The preferred values are as follows: NRF>0.9, PBC1>0.9, and PBC2>3. 
> - Various peak files must meet certain requirements. Please visit the section on output files under the pipeline overview for more information on peak files.
>   - The number of peaks within a replicated peak file should be >150,000, though values >100,000 may be acceptable. 
>   - The number of peaks within an IDR peak file should be >70,000, though values >50,000 may be acceptable.
>   - A nucleosome free region (NFR) must be present.
>   - A mononucleosome peak must be present in the fragment length distribution. These are reads that span a single nucleosome, so they are longer than 147 bp but shorter than 147*2 bp. Good ATAC-seq datasets have reads that span nucleosomes (which allows for calling nucleosome positions in addition to open regions of chromatin).
> - The fraction of reads in called peak regions (FRiP score) should be >0.3, though values greater than 0.2 are acceptable. For EN-TEx tissues, FRiP scores will not be enforced as QC metric. TSS enrichment remains in place as a key signal to noise measure.
> - Transcription start site (TSS) enrichment values are dependent on the reference files used; cutoff values for high quality data are listed in the table below. ",alexg9010,https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/pigx_chipseq/issues/166

The reason is probably the similarity of the two names, since keeping only one analysis is fine. 
One fix is to omit the last underscore to change the `CCNormal_NFR` to `CCNormalNFR`, which renders it another word that can be filled by the snakemake interpolation.",alexg9010,https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/pigx_chipseq/issues/167
