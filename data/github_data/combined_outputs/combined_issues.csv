MDU6SXNzdWU5MzQ3NzU0NDM=,small code change for use of the cdd2cog.pl script with COG20,OPEN,2021-07-01T12:09:37Z,2021-07-01T12:09:37Z,,"Hi!

not really an issue, but putting this here in case the original author doesn't have time to modify the ```cdd2cog.pl``` script for use with the updated COG20 database. I guess this would be more properly done via pull request, but I figure more people might see an opened issue. I also realise this is a ""band-aid"" style fix, but might be useful to someone nonetheless.

if you're interested in using the ```cdd2cog.pl``` script with the COG20 database (which can be found here https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/COG/COG2020/data/) only a small change is required. The body of the script will work perfectly fine, but the information parsed from the ```fun.txt``` and ```whog``` files now needs to be parsed from files with a slightly different name and format. 

```fun.txt``` is now replaced by ```fun-20.tab```
```whog``` can be replaced by ```cog-20.def.tab```
both of these files can be downloaded from the link above

to retrieve the relevant info from these files, the subroutines all the way at the end of ```cdd2cog.pl``` need to be modified. For clarity and ease of copy/pasting, I have pasted the entire subroutine here. The orignal code is still in place, but commented out. The 4 added lines are present under ```# code to parse fun-20.tab file``` and ```# code to parse cog-20.def.tab```. 

after the modifications are made, the script can be run using:
```cdd2cog.pl -r rps-blast.out -c cddid.tbl -f fun-20.tab -w cog-20.def.tab```

Hope this is helpful!

As shown, the CDS in the gff output doesn't have an intron between the two exons. CDS sequences extracted based on these kinds of coordinates must be wrong. Thank you!",Xiao-Zhong,https://github.com/BioJulia/GenomicAnnotations.jl/issues/9,BioJulia++GenomicAnnotations.jl.csv
I_kwDOB7QJcs5r6nXN,Having location field in genes,CLOSED,2023-07-18T19:00:39Z,2024-01-03T09:29:28Z,2023-09-01T08:03:08Z,"Hi all

This package is so great! I was wondering if there is any way to fetch the `location` out of the `gbk.genes` field. Currently we can get all the fields that start with the `/` in the record:

```
gbk.genes[end]

     CDS             47738..47944

```

I want to be able to get the location qualifier `47738..47944` encoded later as a `UnitRange{Int64}` --> `47738:47944`. Is this a feature we can have in `GenomicAnnotations` (or already have)?

However, I have noticed that the current version does not support the basic format of GTF, while it already supports GFF3. Would it be possible to add support for GTF in the future?

BioPython parses the file, so I assume the file is encoded correctly. I'm attaching the file below. Thanks in advance! Really appreciate the package

I_kwDOB7QJcs6arGW3,Type piracy of Base breaks package in 1.11,CLOSED,2024-10-17T14:54:45Z,2024-10-17T16:26:34Z,2024-10-17T16:15:36Z,"This package defines this method:
```
function Base.getproperty(genes::AbstractArray{G, 1}, name::Symbol) where {G <: AbstractGene}
   ....
```
This is piracy, since both `AbstractArray` and `AbstractGene` is implemented in Base, and breaks the package in Julia 1.11.
It may seem like it shouldn't be piracy since you explicitly only overrode `AbstractArray{<:AbstractGene}`, and this package owns `AbstractGene`. And indeed, this piracy should not be able to break code unrelated to this package.
The problem is that this package relies on existing methods for `AbstractArray` working, such as `getproperty`. When this method is overwritten, then any code that used `getproperty` for `AbstractArray{<:AbstractGene}` breaks, which includes basic Base code.

The solution is to stop pirating Base here.",jakobnissen,https://github.com/BioJulia/GenomicAnnotations.jl/issues/14,BioJulia++GenomicAnnotations.jl.csv

I would suggest this be changed to

Thanks for posting some really detailed work on Maker, especially with examples including custom masked repeats. I found a slight error with your `rmOutToGFF3custom` script. As it is written it sorts the `##gff-version 3` header along with the contents of the gff file. Moving one parenthesis fixes it.

This script is provided as-is, with no support and no guarantee of proper or

This script converts the .out file from RepeatMasker to a GFF3 file. Note that the output
is probably not perfect GFF3, so beware with downstream applications. This script
emulates the rmOutToGFF3.pl script supplied with RepeatMasker but provides a fuller ID
(""target="") for each element in column 9 of the GFF. This ID includes the matching element,
like rmOutToGFF3.pl, but also includes the repeat family: in the format <Family>/<Element>.
This change is because many matching elements produced from RepeatModeler have IDs that
provide no information about repeat family classification. Output is written to standard
output (SDOUT).

This script requires requires awk, which should be available on any standard Unix system.

Playing with `starter/build.sh` on a fedora linux system, I get errors like `Failed to parse URI 'ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_29/gencode.v29.annotation.gff3.gz'`. This is because my system uses wget2 which doesn't support ftp.

However, the resources are available over http(s) at the same location,  e.g. `https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_29/gencode.v29.annotation.gff3.gz` works and is probably preferable to using ftp anyway. Changing all ""ftp://"" to ""https://"" in build.sh makes the script work for me.

I_kwDOLctQ6c6TueAp,Interval compatibility across patches,OPEN,2024-08-21T16:09:16Z,2024-08-22T05:30:44Z,,"Hi GenomeKit team! Regarding hg38 patch compatibility. Imagine we are using an annotation on hg38.p12, and define the following three intervals:
```
import genome_kit as gk

genome = gk.Genome('ncbi_refseq.v109') # uses hg38.p12

itv = gk.Interval('chr7', '-', 65967466, 65968201, 'hg38')
itv_p12 = gk.Interval('chr7', '-', 65967466, 65968201, 'hg38.p12')
itv_p13 = gk.Interval('chr7', '-', 65967466, 65968201, 'hg38.p13')
```
Only the interval `itv_p12` will work with the object `genome`. For example, if we try to retrieve the sequence:
```
genome.dna(itv) # error
genome.dna(itv_p12) # works
genome.dna(itv_p13) # error
```
Similar errors occur when trying to find overlapping genes and transcripts, or creating new intervals based on a combination of these three intervals.

However, the sequence information on the main chromosome does not change between patches, and the intervals are actually compatible with each other. It would be useful to have either:
- Support for combining main chromosome intervals across patches 
   - In practice, this would mean that the above operations do not error out, but take advantage of the fact that the coordinates are the same across patches and return the same result as if `itv_p12` were used.
- A way of explicitly lifting/translating intervals across patches
    - Imagine we had something like a `genome.make_compatible(itv)` function that returns an interval on the same patch if the interval is on the main chromosome of the same major assembly. 
        - In this case, `genome.make_compatible(itv)`  and  `genome.make_compatible(itv_p13)` should return `itv_p12`
   - It would be easiest if `genome.make_compatible(itv_p12)` still returned `itv_p12` so we can call the function without checking the reference patch first. 
   - If the intervals are not compatible (e.g. different major assemblies, or non-main chromosome), the function should throw an error
   
This would be especially useful when dealing with intervals saved in a database. Currently, we are restricted to always working with the same patch that the interval was saved on, which limits our choice of annotations. This problem will get worse over time. 

Let me know if any clarificiations are needed. Thank you!

AACR Project GENIE collects VCFs of various flavors from consortium members.  Currently they use vcf2maf to annotate these files.  We desire to move them to the Genome Nexus platform. There we would like to create a script for annotating a set of VCF files using our GN annotation pipeline.  Rough outline:

1. Point tool to folder which contains VCFs of various shapes/size.
2. Run [vcf2vcf](https://github.com/mskcc/vcf2maf/) over files to normalize them. 
3. Run normalized vcfs through @ao508 vcf2maf converter.
3. Annoate mafs using genome nexus annotation client.
4. Combine mafs into single file for import.

Note, for 2:
vcf2vcf is required because there is a need to normalize allele depths which is handled by [FixAllelDepths](https://github.com/mskcc/vcf2maf/blob/v1.6.17/vcf2maf.pl#L986).  Ensure the following option is set (should be set by default)

--retain-format GT,AD,DP

Basically imagine the use case of running genome-nexus-annotation-pipeline twice in a row on the same MAF file. When there is an error in the normalization of chrom/pos/ref/alt1/alt2, we are not able to reproduce the original chrom/pos/ref/alt1/alt2. Let's store a copy as a separate column that's immutable to get around this issue

We could have the following logic:

If the columns prefixed with  `genome_nexus_ignore_original` are missing (`genome_nexus_ignore_original_Chromosome	genome_nexus_ignore_original_Start_Position	genome_nexus_ignore_original_End_Position	genome_nexus_ignore_original_Reference_Allele	genome_nexus_ignore_original_Tumor_Seq_Allele1	genome_nexus_ignore_original_Tumor_Seq_Allele2`) then create these columns and copy over the values from the inputted MAF `Chromosome	Start_Position	End_Position	Reference_Allele	Tumor_Seq_Allele1`

If they are not missing then use the columns prefixed with `genome_nexus_ignore_original` to annotate them instead of the inputted  `Chromosome	Start_Position	End_Position	Reference_Allele	Tumor_Seq_Allele1	Tumor_Seq_Allele2`. We do this because we might have normalized the non-prefixed ones incorrectly before.

Bonus points: note that if we really want to manually change some `genome_nexus_ignore_original` ones, we can add another column prefix like `genome_nexus_ignore_original_manual_override`. That one would be preferred over `genome_nexus_ignore_original`. That way we can continue to keep the immutable column truly immutable and also see which records we manually override.",inodb,https://github.com/genome-nexus/genome-nexus-annotation-pipeline/issues/157,genome-nexus++genome-nexus-annotation-pipeline.csv

1. It is unclear which of the configuration in EXAMPLE is for a user to change and which isn't (e.g. spring configuration that shouldn't be changed is in the EXAMPLE file)
2. When a new default is introduced that requires a value, it will currently break the pipeline for anybody that's upgrading which already has a properties file
3. Using `application.properties` for a command line client is in general questionable imo, everything should be a command line parameter. If we really want to use a configuration file it might be better to pass it as a command line argument and handle missing values etc elegantly with clear user output of what values are missing. Using spring properties files directly can result in very hard to understand errors for users unfamiliar with Java (there might be a way to override the way spring throws missing config errors, that could be another approach)",inodb,https://github.com/genome-nexus/genome-nexus-annotation-pipeline/issues/168,genome-nexus++genome-nexus-annotation-pipeline.csv

Sometimes when annotating a huge MAF, some variants do not get a protein change or the annotation times out. Re-running those failed records produces the amino acid change.

**Solution:**
Would be nice to add a flag to the `annotate` subcommand or let the default behaviour be such that if all the records are not successfully annotated on the first attempt, then the script will continue running the annotator on the remaining unannotated records until no new annotated records are produced in further attempts.

**Logic:**
- Let the annotation run normally the in the first attempt.
- Subset the variants which failed annotation i.e, the `Variant_Classification` is not in `[""Silent"", ""Intron"", ""3'UTR"", ""5'UTR"", ""3'Flank"", ""5'Flank"", ""IGR""]` and the `HGVSp_Short` is `empty` or `Annotation_Status` is `FAILED`. Basically, split the MAF to annotated and unannotated parts.
- Re-run the annotation of the unannotated MAF and merge the annotated records to the annotated MAF.
- Repeat until all the variants are annotated or no new annotated records are produced in the further attempts.

https://github.com/mskcc/vcf2maf/issues/279

Basically occasionally you might want to keep the ref/alt allele bases because it gives you more information about the surrounding bases. There are three options for the base normalization:

1. Strip off only the very first matching base from ref+alt (first)
2. Strip off all matching starting bases from ref+alt (all) -- this is the current behavior
3. Don't do any harmonization (do store all the appropriate fields as if it were normalized) (none)

This could be something that is relevant for both annotation-tools as well as genome-nexus-annotation-pipleine. The former does the vcf2maf conversion, but the latter also does harmonization of bases as well (the API returns harmonized version of chrom/pos/ref/alt). We should prolly add options to both those tools around this, so the annotation pipeline can have some option like this:

```
--strip-matching-bases {first,all,none}
```
And the annotation-tools could have something like:
```
--strip-matching-bases {first,all}
```
For annotation-tools it prolly doesn't make sense to have the ""none"" option since you are starting from the VCF file which by definition lists the additional base in ref and alt for indels

Note that the issue with using ""first' is that if you run the MAF thru multiple times it will change every time until all bases are stripped off. This is not a big deal if you start from the source VCF, which is how it works for most internal pipelines at MSK, but it can be an issue when you use MAF as the source of truth file. Some way to capture immutable genomic locations was [implemented previously](https://github.com/genome-nexus/genome-nexus-annotation-pipeline/pull/173) but never merged so might be good to revisit that. Another option is to add some feature like that in the conversion script from VCF to MAF i.e. add the original VCF fields in the resulting MAF to make sure you don't lose the source of truth. Then whenever you re-annotate you use the source of truth fields rather than the potentially harmonized fields

I would like to change the logging threshold to debug so I can figure out why my annotations are failing. I see the following console output using a minimal example test run:

```sh
docker run -v ${PWD}:/wd genomenexus/gn-annotation-pipeline:master --filename /wd/scratch/minimal_example.in.txt --output-filename /wd/scratch/minimal_example.out.txt
```

```sh

The line `log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger ` seems to indicate the log4j.properties file can not be found and the application instead performs no explicit configuration (https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html#noconfig).

I tried making own image, disabling the entrypoint and running the jar in an interactive shell with:

```sh
cd /genome-nexus-annotation-pipeline
$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -cp ""/genome-nexus-annotation-pipeline/annotationPipeline/src/main/resources"" -Dlog4j.configuration=log4j.properties -jar annotationPipeline/target/annotationPipeline.jar -f /mnt/docker-sandbox-data/scratch/minimal_example.in.txt -o /mnt/docker-sandbox-data/annotate_output/scratch/minimal_example.out.txt
```

or

```sh
$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -Dlog4j.configuration=/genome-nexus-annotation-pipeline/annotationPipeline/src/main/resources/log4j.properties -jar annotationPipeline/target/annotationPipeline.jar -f /mnt/docker-sandbox-data/scratch/minimal_example.in.txt -o /mnt/docker-sandbox-data/annotate_output/scratch/minimal_example.out.txt

to no avail. 

Any help on this front?

Solution:
Would be ideal to use the ""most_severe_consequence"" to update the Consequence (intergenic_variant) and Variant_Classification (IGR) coulumns so these would be filtered out during import.

### Use case:
It would be helpful for users to be able to
1) Point to specific VEP version of genome-nexus. e.g. `<vep_version>.genomenexus.org`
2) Modify the enrichment fields via environment variable

Alternative (instead of ENV variables)
1) User supplied application.properties file. Not friendly for usage in NextFlow

### Deliverables:

Many GFF3 files do not provide these directives, but the `GtGFF3InStream` class conveniently infers theses boundaries from the annotations corresponding to each sequence.

However, it seems that when `##sequence-region` pragmas are provided, they are ignored or overridden by the `GtGFF3InStream` class. For example, I have a GFF3 file with the entry `##sequence-region   chr8 1 1000000` to indicate that the corresponding sequence is 100kb long. However, the right-most annotation in the file spans 88551-92176. When I parse these data with a `GtGFF3InStream` object, I get [1-92176] as the range, rather than [1-100000].

Being able to infer ranges from the annotations is no doubt a very useful feature, but when `##sequence-region` directives are explicitly provided, shouldn't these be honored and used?

Right now there is only the `gt_jobs` variable in `core/thread_api.h` and to include this into the API (which in itself makes sense) there are 3 possible changes:
- rename gt_jobs so it will be recognized as part of one of the classes in threads_api.h. It has to be moved on a line after the class is defined for that to work.
- move `gt_jobs` to `multithread_api` which is a module. This could be complicated, because the definition has to be moved to.
- by far the easiest way: add a comment line before the extern variable, with an Name and codeword module in it. This will add a module with only that variable to the documentation. I propose to name the module Thread like the file it resides in.

So if travis fails just on one test and this is not reproducible, this might be due to some random value, which is very hard to debug without the seed.

Here are some ideas to fix this:

testsuite.rb produces random number, outputs this number and uses this number as a seed for all tests in that run.

To pass the seed value to all the thousands of tests each calling gt multiple times one either has to change all the calls to gt in the testsuite and add -seed=X or we change the gt binary to check for an environmental variable GT_SEED. If defined it will use this. So the testsuite simple has to set that variable and no test-code has to be changed.
The gt-option -seed takes precedence over GT_SEED for those cases where a specific test has to use exactly one seedvalue and the testsuite only generates a random value if GT_SEED is not defined so it is possible to reproduce errors within the testsuite depending on random values.

How to we want to deal with this problem? We could reuse `GtUlong` (or introduce `GtUword`) in such a way that the `unsigned long` behaviour on Linux is mirrored on Windows for `GtUlong` and use `GtUlong` where appropriate.

Or we switch to types which always have a defined size, regardless of the machine.

The reason for that behaviour is that in `gt_type_node_has_parent` in that case the check for parent and child ID equality (which I guess was intended for recursion termination) is always triggered right away, without looking at the ontology.

To fix this one would have to base every decision solely on what is in the adjacency matrices for the ontology DAG, using recursive search in the nodes only to extend the matrices. @gordon do you agree?

This is currently done by specifying `-usedesc` or `-matchdesc` options, or by tagging region IDs with MD5 hashes identifying the respective sequences, in which case the connection is made automagically. However, it is currently possible not to specify `-usedesc` or `-matchdesc` options as they are not mandatory. So in principle, it is possible to give a sequence file (or a GtEncseq, or a set of sequence files) with no hint about region mapping and no MD5 tagging. In this case, the first sequence in the set is (silently) taken as the source for all regions in the annotation. This can be very confusing and misleading if someone simply expects things to work (e.g. when using legacy LTRharvest output with 'seq0', 'seq1'... tags as input for the new LTRdigest which supports `-seqfile`, `-seqfiles`, and `-encseq`). All you eventually get is an error message if you try to access regions outside the sequence length. 
Is there any reason why this behaviour was there in the first place? I am fairly certain I did not implement it on purpose like this, but there were tests that expected it IIRC. I'd propose the following as a suggestion to make things more straightforward:
- Usually expect  `-usedesc` or `-matchdesc` as options if someone uses `-seqfile`, `-seqfiles`, and `-encseq` 
- If `-regionmapping` is used, use the entries in the mapping file to refer to the first sequence in the respective sequence files
- If none of these is given, try to use MD5 mapping or _fail_ when no MD5 is present!

In this case, users would not get unexpected results. Any comments or ideas?

For automated use, e.g. in a GFF/Git-based annotation tracking system, it might be convenient to have it output _all_ errors instead of only the first one. This functionality could, for example, be optional in the parser or input stream, so it may be activated in the validator tool but not in the other GtGFF3InStream-using tools. 
I see that is difficult to do because we try to ensure that everything that comes out of an input stream is guaranteed to be valid, and some errors simply cannot lead to valid annotation graphs. However, one might restrict this more relaxed error output to typically non-fatal errors in GFF3 input.

- Use a `GtFeatureOutStream` to capture the incoming stream of nodes into a `GtFeatureIndex` object.
- Process the nodes in the feature object and store the processed nodes in another `GtFeatureIndex` object.
- Use a `GtFeatureInStream` to deliver the processed nodes from this `GtFeatureIndex` to the next step in the node stream.

I'm having some issues with memory management. When I delete everything properly, I'm running into segfaults and core dumps. I can selectively omit deleting some node stream or feature index objects, but of course this introduces memory leaks that could be a big problem for large data sets.

I've tried to reduce all this to a simple example to wrap my mind around it. See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/standage/8717134). Note that running with valgrind, it will report no memory leaks (except the 5 libpixman cases), but lots of invalid reads. Comment out either line 87 or 89 and the invalid read messages go away, but memory leaks are introduced.

The spec also makes it clear that these methods can be combined.

> The two types of representations can be mixed, allowing large aligned segments to have their own GFF line and score, while small gaps within them are represented using a Gap attribute.

GFF3 produced by NCBI's annotwriter (part of the NCBI C++ toolkit) declares `match` and `cDNA_match` features as multifeatures, but utilizes line-specific `Gap` attributes to list small gaps in the alignment structure. GenomeTools complains about this, with an error message suggesting that multifeatures should have the same Gap attribute for each line. Unless I'm reading something incorrectly, this seems to violate cases explicitly allowed by the GFF3 spec.

As an example, try downloading ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Apis_mellifera/GFF/ref_Amel_4.5_top_level.gff3.gz and running it through `gt gff3`.

I propose to make this behaviour configurable in the parser, as http://www.sequenceontology.org/resources/converter_readme.html does. So depending on this setting either the codon is ignored (as it is already included in the CDS) or the last CDS feature is actually extended to include the stop codon instead of adding a separate new CDS feature.

- After parsing, the `GtAddIdsVisitor` will find that there is no sequence region with a trailing blank and add it. Now there are two sequence regions, one with and one without trailing blank.
- When trying to parse this concoction the next time, the GFF3 parser will complain about a duplicate sequence region and stop.

Data/Programs/genometools-1.5.2/bin/gt ltrharvest -index Pdac_ref2013sindex -out Pdac_ref2013sindex.out99 -outinner Pdac_ref2013sindex.outinner99 -gff3 Pdac_ref2013sindex.gff99 -minlenltr 100 -maxlenltr 6000 -mindistltr 1500 -maxdistltr 25000 -mintsd 5 -maxtsd 5 -motif tgca -similar 99 -vic 10  > Pdac_ref2013sindex.result99

Here is the bug 
Assertion failed: (ulen != 0 && vlen != 0), function gt_evalxdroparbitscoresextend, file src/match/xdrop.c, line 250.

What can I do ?

Thanks a lot for your help,

MDU6SXNzdWUzNDE4ODc2Mg==,-matchdesc and multiple occurrences of IDs in headers,CLOSED,2014-05-23T16:04:40Z,2014-05-29T12:32:38Z,2014-05-29T12:32:38Z,"The `-matchdesc` option causes confusion when a query seqid could match more than sequence in a set. For example, in _D. melanogaster_, there are heterochromatin sequences intermingled with the euchromatin sequences:

```
$ zgrep '>' dmel-all-chromosome-r5.57.fasta.gz | cut -f 1 -d' '
>YHet
>2RHet
>2LHet
>3LHet
>3RHet
>U
>XHet
>dmel_mitochondrion_genome
>2L
>X
>3L
>4
>2R
>3R
>Uextra
```

So using, for example, `-matchdesc` with a sequence ID of `2L` will return `2LHet` as the corresponding sequence as `2LHet` is the first sequence in the set whose description contains `2L`. But it is not the correct one ('2L' coming later in the set). That makes the `-matchdesc` quite unintuitive to use. Moreover, there is AFAICS no other way to find sequences by header matching in a multi-sequence input.
I propose to add another matching option, for instance called `-matchdescstart`, which will behave like many other sequence processing tools do: it will try to match the given sequence ID  _exactly_ against the prefix of each sequence description up to the first whitespace. This way, a one-to-one mapping is obtained and ambiguous results like above should not occur.
I also propose to emit a warning (or even error?) if a `-matchdesc` seqid query matches multiple sequence descriptions so the caller gets notified of this.

Any other suggestions about how to approach this issue?

This is OK for internal CDSs as the DNA parts are concatenated and translated as a whole. However, if the first CDS (in reading direction) in a protein coding transcript has a phase different from zero, the resulting protein products are broken in the current implementation as the necessary amount of bases is not skipped from the beginning of the concatenated sequence while translating.

I am aware of the fact that this can be 'fixed' by forcing a phase of 0 for the first CDS and adjusting the start position of the CDS in this case, but I am currently facing a set of partial gene annotations, a substantial number of which are annotated in this way and I do not want to mess with the gene models.

              when use strict motif and tsd length in search LTR candidates in the LTRharvest, the ~1/3 of the candidates have at least one overhang internal boundaries (the 3' lLTR or 5' rLTR boundary that extend more than enough)

Unfortunately, there are some tools (Tabix, I'm looking at you!) which expect GFF3 output sorted on a individual line basis.  From this point of view, the example above would not be sorted (the polypeptide starts after the last CDS)!

I propose to implement an alternative output stream for annotation graphs, which would output `###` separated blocks not only on the basis of graph connectivity, but also consider overlapping features and place them within the same block, resulting in an output format like the following:

To consider this fact in the interface, we need to model a second edge type to be recorded in the feature nodes.

Generally, when there's many sequences with few annotations each the sequence access takes very long. I propose to implement `-matchdescstart` separately by preprocessing the relevant part of the sequence headers into a hash table when the sequence set is loaded for the first time, allowing to do the mapping in constant time afterwards. 
For `-matchdesc` there is not much one can do as the match positions are unconstrained.

Input needs to be checked for sanity before trying to process it with any of the LTRdigest visitors and rejected if it does not meet the requirements.

One has to adapt the `package.path` global variable with the exact directory to search for the file to load. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to obtain the location of the script which is currently executed (you would need some magic involving the `debug` library), which can become a problem when the script currently executed  is not in the current working directory.

I propose to add a new field to the global `gt` table, say `gt.script_dir`, containing the directory the current script is located in (based on the path used for calling it). If there was no path, i.e. the script is in the current working directory, `gt.script_path` should be `.`.

```
package.path = gt.script_dir .. ""/../?.lua;"" .. package.path

I had previously set a lower bound of 650px, but had not set an upper bound. Therefore when it tried to create a graphic ≈42k pixels in width, naturally Cairo failed. However, the failure was silent, and even though it was followed directly by a assertion error (`src/annotationsketch/graphics_cairo.c:129`) it still took me some time to isolate the issue.

With a bit of experimentation I found that `cairo_image_surface_create` gives up somewhere between 30000 and 40000 pixels. The exact value may be documented somewhere, but I didn't find it with a quick search. Regardless, this is way above what is expected for typical usage. I ended up using 10000px as the upper bound for ParsEval.

Perhaps we should drop a warning message to stderr whenever the width is above some threshold (e.g., 10000) indicating that if something fails it's probably due to a width issue?

The only stop codon possible in this context is TAG, but I would expect the translator to give me X here instead of a stop codon. This currently makes some of my validator scripts give incorrect results, stating that gene models have internal stop codons while they may not.

MDU6SXNzdWU1MjEzMDAyOQ==,Use ctypes idiomatically for Python bindings,OPEN,2014-12-16T15:57:06Z,2015-01-08T10:18:24Z,,"We recently updated the Python bindings so that they would work ""correctly"" on OS X as well as Linux--that is, it does not segfault and produces correct output. However, the updates abandoned some of the nice features of `ctypes` that did not seem to work correctly on OS X. See #211.

I opened up [a bug report](http://bugs.python.org/issue22945) with the Python folks, and their reply pointed out something that we had missed. See eryksun's message: essentially, we need to do an additional conversion/dereference for pointers to C objects.

``` c
// Old way: problems on OS X
self._as_parameter_ = self.g

// New way: no problems
self._as_parameter_ = c_void_p(self.g)
```

I confirmed that this fix worked for my dummy C library example, so I don't see any reason it shouldn't work for the GenomeTools python bindings. I would much rather use `ctypes` idiomatically than go through and do the type/error checking that seemed inevitable from working with pointers directly.

Also, the `gt interfeat` tool should probably be able to also emit the region between the first/last item of the outside type and the start/end of the sequence region containing the feature.

extractfeat tries to pick reference sequences using MD5 tag by default. To look up by id, `-matchdescstart` option must be used.

I am not sure if it's common to refer to ref seqs by their MD5 in GFF files. I think mapping by seqid is more common. And `-matchdescstart` option is not intuitive - even after reading the docs it's not clear that this is the option one is looking for. I resorted to trial and error to pick b/w `-matchdesc`, `-usedesc`, and `-matchdescstart`.

I suggest setting `-matchdescstart` the default, or removing the option altogether if gt can intelligently decide whether to use MD5 or seqid (so as to not break the current behavior).

I am trying to get LTRHarvest and LTRDigest to work on my computer and I figured I'd try an easy small scale test first just to see what the outputs actually look like and if I can manage it since I have pretty much no bio informatics background.

I chose a small file with 3 25kb locuses from the dog genome that I know to contain an almost complete provirus each. However every time I try to start suffixerator as described in the LTRHarvest manual, it tells me my sequence is empty.

My fasta sequences are in a text file ending in .fas as your exemple file does (even though I'm not sure the file extension is important) and follow the format : 

.>sequence_name
_sequence in caps A,T,G,C_
.>sequence2_name
_sequence2 in caps A,T,G,C_
etc...

(Without the . in front of the >, just put it there to avoid GitHub's formatting)

Why does suffixerator think my sequences are empty ?

We have a GFF3 file containing repeats. They do not have 'ID' fields, as we do not have unique ids, but they have 'description' fields.
For some of those, the description is a string 'ID'.
As far as I am aware, none of this is against GFF3 specifications.
When running gt gff3 with the -retainids option however, the 'ID' description is picked up as an 'ID' with no value and added to the start of the attributes fields.
Is this meant to be or could it be updated to only use 'ID' if it is before the '='?

I've been trying to run 'gt ltrdigest' on a compute farm. I found that if I run one LTRdigest job on the farm, it runs fine, but if I submit lots of LTRdigest jobs at once (all using the same -hmms directory of HMM files), then I get errors and the jobs die, with errors relating to the HMM files. 
I then tried setting the TMPDIR environment variable to be a different local directory for each LTRdigest job, and was able to run lots of jobs at once on our compute farm. All the jobs seemed to finish fine, and at first I thought this had solved the problem.
However, I noticed that the output gff from LTRdigest didn't have any 'protein_match' features when I ran lots of jobs at once on the compute farm (while if I just ran one job on the farm at a time, the output gff did have 'protein_match' features). I'm not sure why this is, because the *fas files for the protein domains are produced fine. However, I think it must be that somehow the hmmer search didn't run ok?
Please let me know if you'd like me to send more info or files.

Are there really widespread issues with memory management that are pervasive across different Linux distributions? Or are these false positives?

Either way, I've tried creating suppressions files (they're massive and I don't have time to manually inspect them) but it never seems to be a comprehensive solution.

I know GenomeTools has its own init and clean functions, which IIRC do some memory auditing. Is all the GT memory debugging included in the library or do you ever use external tools like Valgrind?

This happens whether i install the extra dependancies via brew or not. 1.5.6 however compiles without issue. I'm running Yosemite 10.10.5. Also, separate point, the INSTALL file for 1.5.7 has a little typo:

- 32bit=yes        to compile a 32-bit version

The problem seems to be that the SYSTEM=Windows environment variable is not passed through to   `scripts/travis_test.rb`. I'm wondering if `env = {}` in the scripts resets the complete environment. But if it does, that it is weird that the tests with `cairo=no` build correctly.

My first idea was to just drop these from the stream, e.g. as in https://github.com/satta/genometools/commit/534146c719d2bd71e93b6ae323bf998c529ea839 -- any ideas or other suggestions?

I have a bit of a problem with gt gff3, I wanted to check if I have duplicate gene ids in my file, but the flag seems not to be working.

After gt gff3 -sort yes -retainids yes -checkids yes test.gff3 > gt.out.gff3

[gt.out.gff3.txt](https://github.com/genometools/genometools/files/42371/gt.out.gff3.txt)
[test.gff3.txt](https://github.com/genometools/genometools/files/42372/test.gff3.txt)

There is no warning about duplicate gene ids although they are present. The duplicate gene gets grouped with the first gene.  I tested v1.5.7 and v.1.5.4
Is that expected behavior? It seems counter-intuitive.

I also have a historical question. I was trying to re-run some analysis from 2012. Back then I used v.1.3.5 and I used to get warnings:
warning: feature ID ""BOLE_PAN00005191.1:cds"" not unique: changing to BOLE_PAN00005191.1:cds.1

But what I did not notice is that for some genes the ids got changed and for the others not.

So I ended up with a mosaic file which looked like this: 
[historical.mosaic.gff3.txt](https://github.com/genometools/genometools/files/42373/historical.mosaic.gff3.txt)

Any idea what could have caused that back then? It seems bizarre. It is important 
for my re-analysis as I am trying to understand if it was a strange gff3 file or unexpected 
program behavior. Again no errors.

Best wishes,

I would expect the two RVT_1 matches in this element to be chained together. Some of these cases can be filtered with the domain match cutoff method and e-value threshold, but in this example, these appear to be very strong matches that would not be filtered by a sensible threshold. Is there a reason why they are split?

I analysis the LTR  chromosome by chromosome using LTRharvest and LTRdigest. If there are 5 chromosomes,  I would get 5 gff3 files finally. Then I want use LTRsift to help me filter  candidate sequence. but I also need to analysis chromosome by chromosome because LTRsift only allow select one associated indexname but there are 5 indexnames in fact. If  I do this one chromosome by chromosome, it will influence the classification. For example, A candidate in Chr1 would be the same family with B candidate in Chr2. so, how could I make those 5 index files into 1 index files?

I  combined the 5 chromsomes sequence files to 1 file and tried to only produce one gff3 file and index file through LTRhavest. Howerver, the analysis was out of memory of computer. I cannot image what happen if I merge 20 chromsomes sequence files into 1 file.

I have read the papaer you published about LTRsift, there were two analysis about the fly and mouse and there are also more than one chromosome in every part, how did you solve the problem? Thanks

So what I am pretty sure is going on here is that since the CDS pieces are not in linear order along the Mitochondria plasmid, your tool is reordering them to be that way.
Here is that order:

```

However, for transplicing this is the wrong behavior.
If the rows are taken as seen in the file, the phase is correct.
If the rows are reordered then it would expect the segment from 190740 to 190761 to have a phase of 2.

See attached excel sheet.

Here is the Genbank version of the CDS.  The order in the GFF matches the GenBank coordinates given.

Couple of potential suggestions on how to handle.
1) If ""trans-splicing"" or ""trans-spliced"" and do not reorder
2) Check the phase, but allow it to be warning or a stricter checking option.

@stefan-kurtz Can I revert the commit? The `GtBioseq` was always about automatically creating the corresponding indices and I think in that case it make more sense to have them in the same directory as the original sequence files (and it's the behaviour we had so far). Or did I miss anything? I see the reason for consistency with the other tools, but it breaks some tools and would require some work in them and might cause problems for existing users.

The gt gff3 tool (latest release, version 1.5.8, linux x86_64 binaries) complains that the phase is incorrect for this entry, with the following error:

```
warning: CDS feature on line 19 in file ""stdin"" has the wrong phase 1 -> correcting it to 0
warning: CDS feature on line 17 in file ""stdin"" has the wrong phase 0 -> correcting it to 2

warning: CDS feature on line 7 in file ""stdin"" has the wrong phase 1 -> correcting it to 0
warning: CDS feature on line 6 in file ""stdin"" has the wrong phase 0 -> correcting it to 2
```

The complaints begin after line 21, ie an exon/CDS line with length 1 (45276 .. 45276). 
This seems wrong to me, for the following reasons:

1- If I have understood the method of calculation right, the phase should be calculated by taking the modulo 3 of the amount of sequence already met before encountering the current CDS segment; see the code at the beginning of the issue report.

   My function agrees with the phases present in the input GFF record I pasted in the comment, but not with GenomeTools; it reports the total CDS length as being 1788 ie a number divisible by 3.

2 - I can obtain the same results as GenomeTools in terms of phases by adding 2 instead of 1 to the total_cds_length variable when encountering the 1-bp exon:

```
def __calculate_phases(coding, previous):
    # Previous indicates whether the record began with a phase different from 0
    # for incomplete gene models

    total_cds_length = -previous

    __calculated_phases = []
    for cds_segment in coding:
        length = cds_segment[1][1] - cds_segment[1][0] + 1
        # This agrees with GenomeTools
        if length == 1:
             length += 1
        phase = (3 - (total_cds_length % 3)) % 3
        total_cds_length += length
        __calculated_phases.append(phase)

    return total_cds_length, __calculated_phases
```

The result in this case will agree with GenomeTools regarding the phases, _but the total CDS length will be incorrect (1789, and 1789 % 3 == 1)_. This seems quite wrong.

I think I saw repfind errors fail a few times and looking at the code of the test I am not sure why they would fail only sometimes. Probably race conditions, but it was the grep that failed and the file it was supposed to process was touched before, so it existed.
Also, the tests in gt_repfind_include around lines 200ff are repeated 3 times without a visible reason?
Could someone who has worked on that code have a look? Maybe they understand where there could be a problem with parallel test execution.

I am trying to use the mkindex program to find all 20-mers with a minimal occurrence (10 in my example) but I need the program to check both strands of my sequences. I don't know if this is possible but I found the -mirrored option in the suffixerator program. When I use this option to construct the esa, I get an error message when I run mkindex. Is this a bug or is it simply not possible to search on both strands?

These commands work:

```
gt suffixerator -dna -pl -tis -suf -lcp -v -db seqs.fas -indexname seqs
gt tallymer mkindex -minocc 10 -mersize 20 -esa seqs

It could be simple question here. I googled but didn't find a good working solution.
Is there a simple way to reverse complement annotation?  I mean annotation - CDS, exons, etc ... what is marked in ""+"" stand will be swapped to ""-"" strand with positions corrected according to reverse complemented sequence.

This is NOT an Issue. I tried to get my question answered via gitter, but I have no response there. Therefore, I have to reluctantly post here.

I had a question on the ""GT CDS"" command. I would like to add the CDS feature to my Gff3 file, that has exons in it. I saw that genometools can do this for you.

gt cds -startcodon -finalstopcodon -seqfile foo.fasta -o foo.gff3 [GFF3-FILE]

1) I am looking for the CDS to be the longest ORF with an ATG start codon per mRNA. Do the gff3 coordinates in the output reflect that? 

2) It is possible that a single mRNA will give rise to two CDS of equal size but with different start and stops. In case of such conflicts, what does gt cds do?

3) I did not see a flag for specifying the genetic code. Is this by default ""standard vertebrate""?

I have a multifasta file with examplars LTR elements obtained using LTR-harvest and LTR-digest follwing the ""Repeat Library Construction-Advanced"" pipeline.

http://weatherby.genetics.utah.edu/MAKER/wiki/index.php/Repeat_Library_Construction-Advanced

I'd like to annotate these fasta LTR elements using the pHMM search option of LTR-digest.
I have installed genometools-1.5.10 including the pHMM search option.

$ make with-hmmer=yes threads=yes cairo=no
$ make install cairo=no prefix=/home/data/genometools-1.5.10/bin

I downloaded all the HMMs from GyDB and converted them in HMMER3.
I created the suffix for my multifasta file:

$ gt suffixerator -tis -des -dna -ssp -db MyLTR.fasta -indexname MyLTR

Finally, I have launched the following command line:

$ gt -j 10 ltrdigest -hmms GyDB/*.hmm -- MyLTR > ltrdigest

The process is running with less than 1 CPU and the output never updates.

Did I miss something in the command line that stuck the process? Or is there something in general that I am missing?

## Problem Definition
I need to extract intron sequences. So when I use these coords, I get the same intron DNA sequence thrice. This happens for several intron regions. How do I extract sequences without redundancy? i.e. the combination of fasta header and sequence should appear just once? Currently I am using gt generated GFF3 file in combination with bedtools getfasta to extract DNA sequences with GFF3+Genome fasta files as inputs

using `gt --version` prints besides other information `gt (GenomeTools) 1.5.11` (with the current master).
The last Release was 1.5.10 so there is not really a 1.5.11 and, if one has to handle different compiles of gt, all are the same version unless one is older than a recent release.

If one now uses `git describe --tags` on the current master one gets: `v1.5.10-19-g161fb4c21` - which is much more helpful in my eyes. It contains the version, the number of commits following the release-tag and even the hash of HEAD.

The only Problem I see with this: if one compiles the source from a download other than git, this information would not be present. But it could be included in the VERSION file as a fallback for our releases on GitHub?

nevertheless I question the policy of printing a version number that is not released yet.

Recently, when I was running LTR_harvest, an issue comes up and I have no idea what it means and how to solve this problem.

The genometools was installed by conda 
`conda install -c bioconda genometools-genometools`

The index was generated by following the manual:
`gt suffixerator -db etuer.test.fasta -indexname etuer -tis -suf -lcp -des -ssp -sds -dna`

Then I tried to run LTR_harvest by using the command:
`gt ltrharvest -index etuer -minlenltr 100 -maxlenltr 7000 -mintsd 4 -maxtsd 6 -motif TGCA -motifmis 1 -similar 85 -vic 10 -seed 20 -seqids yes`

However, the software gave a message and ended:
`cannot flock: Function not implemented`

What does this mean? Is there something wrong with the installation or the software setup?
Thanks in advance!

If file locking isn't available the process shouldn't hang.  It should die early ( should locking be absolutely necessary ) or timeout after a reasonable amount of time.  This holds up pipelines when a user inadvertently runs on an unsupported filesystem.

It would be helpful if when adding introns to a gff3 it would also add ID's instead of just Parent's. Similar to how exons and cds's have ID's associated with their parent.

I am using the `-retainids -addintrons` flags.

Currently, the results look like:

```

I am running LTR harvest on a 2.7 Gb genome. It gives a segmentation fault and fails repeatedly on multiple machines. RAM is not the issue as I have tried reserving up to 300 GB for this job. Even though the result is only a segmentation fault, it takes 72 hours to run. This is the exact error:

MDU6SXNzdWU5MDAxNTA5NzE=,"Proper way to ""delete"" children nodes or whole feature trees in gt-python?",CLOSED,2021-05-25T01:09:01Z,2021-06-23T18:06:06Z,2021-06-23T08:22:49Z,"## Problem description

This is both a question and a crash report:

I have been given a series GFF files that have issues with children coordinates (I don't control the annotation source).  Specifically in some genes, some of the exon children happen to overlap (no intron and children have a slight overlap).   From what I see in the code I am not allowed to alter a previously parsed child node's coordinates, but rather to make a new one with the correct coordinates and hopefully delete the problematic child node (the one originally parsed from the file)

There is a gt-python function that implements the C functionality in ""gtlib.gt_feature_node_add_child"" for adding newly created child nodes to a parent feature tree.   However I haven't found a corresponding python method for deleting a node (C code has gt_genome_node_delete or gt_feature_node_remove_leaf)

Have I missed it in the gt-python code? What is the proper way to do this? or maybe is not implemented yet?  

So instead I attempted to make calls to the C methods directly like this in my python script:

```
    from gt.dlload import gtlib
    ...
    gtlib.gt_feature_node_remove_leaf(feature, tfn)  # where tfn is the current child node iterated with FeatureNodeIteratorDirect()

```
Having the last line in my python code that is iterating over feature trees in a FeatureIndexMemory index causes the script to crash with a segmentation fault but no further message. 

Is this a bug or simply the wrong way to go about this?

No.  I downloaded precompiled binaries and libraries from two separate places (Bioconda, Ubuntu packages) and both had same behaviour on multiple versions.  I tryed the Bioconda solution on two distributions (Ubuntu and CentOS)

## What operating system (e.g. Ubuntu, Mac OS X), OS version (e.g. 15.10, 10.11) and platform (e.g. x86_64) are you using?
Ubuntu 20.04  and CentOS 7 on x86_64,  both using python3.6 or above

Thanks,

Hi, 

I was running LTRdigest on the result of LTRharvest. The process is still running (in S status). But the output stopped about ten days ago. I used strace -p to see what's going on for gt and hmmscan. The output is not not updating.

Travis-CI.org is shutting down and we would need to migrate our CI to Travis-CI.com (https://blog.travis-ci.com/2021-05-07-orgshutdown).
Regarding Travis, we have seen that macOS builds take too long because there are no binary packages for the dependencies for the OS version they are running, so they need to be built from source, which exceeds their time limit for runs.

I am wondering whether we might want to migrate the CI to GitHub Actions completely, which appears to be as a well-integrated, feature-rich solution, which will hopefully be supported for a long time. This would also remove dependencies to external services even more.

Any comments? Alternatively we could just move the CI to Travis-CI.com as described and just remove the macOS tests.",satta,https://github.com/genometools/genometools/issues/973,genometools++genometools.csv
MDU6SXNzdWU5MTU0NDM3ODM=,"Issue with ""source"" in freshly created FeatureNodes in gtpython",OPEN,2021-06-08T20:14:01Z,2021-06-23T08:49:48Z,,"## Problem description

Dear @satta : 

Using Python3, when creating a GFF FeatureNode from scratch,  setting its ""source"" field with fn.set_source() method results in the storage of a string that is possibly twice encoded.

If the user requests the source data back with fn.get_source() method, what the user gets back is a proper string that falsely resembles a ""bytes"" object.   Attempting to decode the object results in an attribute error because the object does not have a ""decode"" attribute.   

The object is already a string,  but it retains (as a string) the format  b'text'  which looks like a bytes object. (See code below)

I assume the source logic is attempting to be transparent to both python2 and python3.  I did not test with python2.

## example python3.8 code ""test_newfeat_source.py"" follows
```python
#!/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

from gt.extended.feature_node import FeatureNodeIteratorDirect

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    seqid = ""foo""
    seqsource = ""BAR""
    gene = FeatureNode.create_new(seqid, ""gene"", 100, 900, ""+"")
    gene.set_source(  seqsource   )
    exon1 = FeatureNode.create_new(seqid, ""exon"", 100, 200, ""+"")
    exon1.set_source(  seqsource   )
    gene.add_child(exon1)
    exon2 = FeatureNode.create_new(seqid, ""exon"", 800, 900, ""+"")
    exon2.set_source(  seqsource   )
    gene.add_child(exon2)

    fin = FeatureNodeIteratorDepthFirst(gene)
    while True:
        fn = fin.next()
        if not fn:
            break
        tfn_source = fn.get_source().decode('UTF-8')
        print(fn, tfn_source, fn.get_type())

    print(""\n..After reformating source gff3 field..."")
    locregex=re.compile(""b'(.+)'$"")
    fin = FeatureNodeIteratorDepthFirst(gene)
    while True:
        fn = fin.next()
        if not fn:
            break
        tfn_source = fn.get_source().decode('UTF-8')
        #tfn_source = str(fn.get_source())
        if (tfn_source.startswith(""b'"")):
            locpatternsearch = locregex.search(tfn_source)
            tfn_source = locpatternsearch.group(1)               #         <=== FIXed here
        print(f'The type of obj ""source"" is {type(tfn_source)}')

Dear @satta : 

I use GenomeTools python library to fix or modify GFF files provided by external collaborators when these don't match the spec or don't fit our internal systems.   Many times this involves issues with coordinate systems (coordinate translation for just a region of a chromosome or some major re-arrangement) or fixing other items in the object (attributes, intron/exon boundaries, etc).

Sometimes, it would be simpler to modify an existing FeatureNode object in place rather than to make a a new one to copy most of the old node's attributes and fix the one attribute or coordinates that need fixing from ""failed"" object.

It would be nice to do something like this to the existing FeatureNode class (or one that inherits from it):  

```python
#... as part of class definition ...
def update_range(self, this_start, this_end):
    newrange = Range( this_start, this_end )
    try:
        print(f""Setting range of to : {newrange}"")
        gtlib.gt_genome_node_set_range(self.gn, newrange)
    except:
        raise Exception(""Unable to update the range"")
```

But the code above fails because ""newrange"" is not the C GtRange object expected..  I am not sure what I should be passing from the Python side.   And actually it would be lovely if the python FeatureNode class would support this.

Another nice to have method  would be if the python existing FN.add_attribute()  method (or  a new one)  used the C library  [gtlib.gt_feature_node_set_attribute()](https://github.com/genometools/genometools/blob/694fe366e92d56d2b70ec7ef5742a75560e9a992/src/extended/feature_node.c#L683)   (which allows override of existing attribute) instead of [gtlib.gt_feature_node_add_attribute](https://github.com/genometools/genometools/blob/694fe366e92d56d2b70ec7ef5742a75560e9a992/gtpython/gt/extended/feature_node.py#L157) (expects attribute to be brand new)

I will be happy to submit pull requests, but need to get familiar with the process first.

Cheers,

Mauricio L.

An error occurs when issuing the sort command on my gff3 file. It seems like the gt program is classifying a single feature as a multi-feature, which leads to an error. The error is copied below: 

**gt gff3: error: the multi-feature with ID ""None"" on line 1911 in file ""input.gff3"" has a different attribute 'Parent' than its counterpart on line 1904 ('mRNA37983' vs. 'mRNA37984')**

I am fairly certain that the ID=""None"" for the CDS is causing this problem. Please let me know if there is a way within gt to circumvent this issue or if you have a suggestion for manually fixing this naming problem (if you agree that this is the cause of the error).

I_kwDOAKqP_M5FO60m,Running LTRharvest/digest with parallel,CLOSED,2022-03-07T15:05:08Z,2022-09-21T09:32:51Z,2022-09-21T09:32:51Z,"Hello, here is my issue. I hope someone will be able to help me! Thanks in advance

## Problem description
I’m running LTR harvest/digest and I faced some issues. 
I have over 200 species so I wanted to run several species at once. To do so I wrote a bash function to use with gnu parallel that allows to run several jobs at the same time. When I checked this morning I realised I had a lot of errors like these:

```
Error: File format problem, trying to open HMM file /tmp/198a084286222afb27419fcb9d8e6170.
Opened /tmp/198a084286222afb27419fcb9d8e6170.h3m, a pressed HMM file; but format of its .h3i file unrecognized

gt ltrdigest: error: HMMER child process terminated with error

Error: Unexpected error 7 in opening hmm file /tmp/198a084286222afb27419fcb9d8e6170.

```

I tried to run one species individually and it runs smoothly and found more data than my first parallel run. I tried again with 2 species running at the same time and got the “Unexpected error 7 in opening hmm file” again for one of the chromosomes. My thought is I can’t run LTRharvest/digest on several species at the same time. Is there a way around that?


## Exact command line call triggering the problem

I think it's this one?
```
gt -j 2 ltrdigest -hmms ../Domains/*.hmm  -outfileprefix LTRh/${file}_LTRdigest -seqfile ${file} -matchdescstart < LTRh/${file}_LTRdigest_sorted.gff3 > LTRh/${file}_LTRdigest.gff3

```

## What GenomeTools version are you reporting an issue for (as output by `gt -version`)?

I'm using gt on a server so I haven't installed it. But the installation is ok I think as there are no issue with doing one individual run.

When running Analysis (~/CpGoe/1_Count_CpGoe.ipynb), you used part of a python script (~/dn_ds/Dn_Ds_CodeML.ipynb) to extract the longest CDS per gene, so I looked for it.
However, I could not find that python script.

Perhaps it is because the version of the directory is newer.

Where can I find the original python script?

I_kwDOECJc2M6g7H2k,Running workflow using RefSeq genomes instead of Ensembl,OPEN,2024-11-27T21:17:38Z,2024-11-27T21:17:38Z,,"Great for your workflow, really useful guide to perform Genome Annotation.
Unfortunately, I got stuck in the step `4c. Create CDS-only annotation bed file`, because I only obtain empty files. I think that I know the reason, so here is my hypothesis.

I'm using genomes from `RefSeq`, and so far in a lot of examples, if not all, I found that the genome annotation relies on genomes from `Ensembl`, which of course have another notation related to the IDs.

So, I started running the script `WriteChromLengthBedFromFasta.py`, using a `*_genomic.fna` file from the following [link](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/020/171/115/GCF_020171115.1_ASM_NN_V1/). For example, that file only contains a fasta file with the sequence of chromosome 1. After the conversion, my new `bed` file looks like this:
```
NC_000001.11	0	248956422
NT_187361.1	0	175055
NT_187362.1	0	32032
NT_187363.1	0	127682
NT_187364.1	0	66860
NT_187365.1	0	40176
NT_187366.1	0	42210
NT_187367.1	0	176043
NT_187368.1	0	40745
NT_187369.1	0	41717
```
The second column contains only **0**. This output made me understand that at some point I got an empty file because the information was incorrect, why I say that?, because other examples available contain **0 and other numbers**, so my question is:

- What do you think is happening? 
- Did anyone try to run this with RefSeq genomes too?
- Do I need to use another `.fna` file?

I really want to avoid changing to `Ensembl` genomes, because I had a lot of work already done with `RefSeq` data.
Any comment about what could be the source of the issue is more than welcome!",MauriAndresMU1313,https://github.com/harvardinformatics/GenomeAnnotation/issues/10,harvardinformatics++GenomeAnnotation.csv

I run RepeatMasker on different libraries ( one is build by RepeatModeler, another is 'species' contained in the RepBase ) according to your command, but I add the parameter `-xsmall [returns repetitive regions in lowercase (rest capitals) rather than masked]` because I notice it is recommended that the braker runs on genomic sequences that have been softmasked for Repeats. And also the option `--softmasking` is suitable for softmasked genomes. The command looks like this:
```
RepeatMasker -pa 20 -lib 01_repeatModeler-denovo-repeat.lib/RM_*/consensi.fa.classified -html -gff -xsmall -dir 02_delete-denovo-lib-result genome.fa &>RepeatMasker_run.log1
RepeatMasker -pa 20 -species ""Lepidoptera"" -html -gff -xsmall -dir 03_delete-repeatmasker-lib-result 02_delete-denovo-lib-result/genome.fa.masked &>RepeatMasker_run.log2
RepeatMasker -pa 20 -species ""Lepidoptera"" -html -gff -xsmall -noint -dir 04_delete-repeamasker-noint-result 03_delete-repeatmasker-lib-result/genome.fa.masked.masked &>RepeatMasker_run.log3
```
I have compared the two masked genome generated by run 1 & 2, I see some sequences that is masked in the first run (with `-lib`) is unmasked in the second run (with `-species`). I think this case is caused by the option `-xsmall`, so I run again above commands but delete the option `-xsmall` and this problem is solved.

It is confusing that this pipeline use the genome.fa.masked.masked in `03_delete-repeatmasker-lib-result/genome.fa.masked.masked` directory rather than the genome.fa.masked.masked.masked in `04_delete-repeamasker-noint-result/genome.fa.masked.masked.masked` directory to run BRAKER. 

So what the meaning of run 3 ( with `-noint` ) ? If we run RepeatMasker in hardmasking model, I think the `braker.pl` shouldn't add the option `--softmasking`. If we run RepeatMasker in softmasking model, does the better way is to combine the libraries into one library as mentioned by jebrosen https://github.com/Dfam-consortium/TETools/issues/20#issuecomment-983927917 and then feed the genome.fa.masked ( soft-masking ) to BRAKER with `--softmasking` ?",yshcai,https://github.com/meiyang12/Genome-annotation-pipeline/issues/3,meiyang12++Genome-annotation-pipeline.csv

I noticed that you use Dfam as your repeat library. Could you consider to add  DNApipeTE and REPET which are tools for de novo annotation and soft masking of transposable elements (TEs) in genome assemblies, similar to The Extensive de novo TE Annotator (EDTA) and RepeatMasker.

DNApipeTE is a pipeline that includes several steps for TE annotation and soft masking, including repeat identification, classification, and masking. DNApipeTE utilizes several other tools, including RepeatModeler, RepeatMasker, and RepeatExplorer, to perform these tasks. The output of DNApipeTE includes a consensus library of repeat sequences, as well as annotations of putative TE locations in the genome, and a soft-masked genome assembly.

REPET is another pipeline that includes several steps for TE annotation and soft masking, including repeat identification, classification, clustering, and masking. REPET utilizes several other tools, including RepeatModeler, RepeatMasker, and PILER, to perform these tasks. The output of REPET includes a consensus library of repeat sequences, as well as annotations of putative TE locations in the genome, and a soft-masked genome assembly.

EDTA is a tool that is specifically designed for de novo annotation of transposable elements (TEs) in genome assemblies. The output of EDTA includes a consensus library of repeat sequences, as well as annotations of putative TE locations in the genome.

Both DNApipeTE and REPET provide similar functionalities to EDTA and RepeatMasker, and the output of these pipelines can be used for downstream analyses. However, the specific algorithms and parameters used by these pipelines may differ, resulting in different outputs and soft masking results. The choice of which tool to use will depend on the specific needs of the analysis and the characteristics of the genome assembly being analyzed.

Thank you for considering.

Hi,
I recently came across Mikado which is a pipeline to identify the most useful or “best” set of transcripts from multiple transcript assemblies. Our approach leverages transcript assemblies generated by multiple methods to define expressed loci, assign a representative transcript and return a set of gene models that selects against transcripts that are chimeric, fragmented or with short or disrupted CDS. Loci are first defined based on overlap criteria and each transcript therein is scored based on up to 50 available metrics relating to ORF and cDNA size, relative position of the ORF within the transcript, UTR length and presence of multiple ORFs. Mikado can also utilize blast data to score transcripts based on proteins similarity and to identify and split chimeric transcripts. Optionally, junction confidence data as provided by [Portcullis](https://github.com/maplesond/portcullis) can be used to improve the assessment. The best-scoring transcripts are selected as the primary transcripts of their respective gene loci; additionally, Mikado can bring back other valid splice variants that are compatible with the primary isoform.

![giy093fig1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/588297/231946974-c409f5db-f1a1-4b7a-aa49-d982571c5b38.jpeg)

Mikado uses GTF or GFF files as mandatory input. Non-mandatory but highly recommended input data can be generated by obtaining a set of reliable splicing junctions with Portcullis_, by locating coding ORFs on the transcripts using either [Transdecoder](https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder/) or [Prodigal](https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal), and by obtaining homology information through either [BLASTX](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download) or [DIAMOND](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/).

Could the output from Mikado be used to train Augustus, GlimmerHMM and SNAP?

Than you for considering.

Best wishes,

Currently, RepeatMasker runs on chunks of the assembly, containing full scaffolds/chromosomes. For highly contiguous assemblies, this can mean excessively long run times. Investigate whether repeat masking can be performed on sub-regions of the scaffolds in parallel without losing repeat regions.

I am running the most current version of @marchoeppner dev branch on Tower on a real dataset. The workflow passed repeat masking and produced the `consensi.fa` file but failed very quickly at the subsequent staging process with: 
```
cp: can't stat '/.nextflow/assets/marchoeppner/genomeannotator/assets/repeatmasker/my_genome.fa': No such file or directory
```
Since I ran this on Tower it's a little difficult to debug things in the `.nextflow/assets` directory so this isn't obvious to me yet where this `my_genome.fa` file was supposed to come from.

I conducted a run using the following command and nextflow.config.
conda activate nf-core
nextflow run nf-core/genomeannotator -r dev -profile conda

Command error:
.command.sh: 行 2: gaas_fasta_filter_by_size.pl: not found such a command

How can I install required executables including the gaas_fasta_filter_by_size.pl script?

P.S. I tried to run with 'nextflow run nf-core/genomeannotator -r dev -profile singularity' before using -profile conda.
But I encountered the same error as ""#18 Pipeline fail at REPEATMASKER_STAGELIB"".
In this case, several parameter settings, including singularity.runOptions/singularity.envWhitelist in nextflow.config and SINGULARITY_BIND, had no effect.

- [ ] Merqury. Phasing assessment
- [ ] PLOTSR. Chromosome level summary synteny.
- [ ] MUMMER/DOTPLOT. Sequence level synteny.
- [ ] TEsorter. Captures TEs in protein domains.
- [ ] Asmgene. For evaluating gene completeness and duplication.

Written by SIFT team:
I looked at your gff file and it's missing a few things.  Please look at the gtf examples like homo_sapiens_small or C.ruddii if the explanation below is unclear.

1) Add rows for ""start_codon"" and ""stop_codon""
We need this because the program has to demarcate when translation starts and stops (genes can have 5' and 3' UTRs in the exon). 

2) The 9th column is missing some fields that SIFT is looking for. 

2a) The program will look for a protein_id in the 9th column. If you don't have a protein_id, maybe use the transcript id which is usually a 1-1 mapping with a protein id.

2b) For each row, please specify the biotype. It can be protein_coding  
gene_biotype ""protein_coding"" or noncoding RNA (e.g. ""rRNA"", ""miRNA""), etc. SIFT will only predict on protein_coding rows.
Here's an example on how to change the 9th column:

OLD:
HanXRQCP    BioFileConverter    exon    98077    98226    .    -    .    transcript_id ""mRNA:HanXRQCPg0580291""; gene_id ""gene:HanXRQCPg0580291""; gene_name ""Ha

In the 2nd column in the Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.83_trimmed.gtf.gz specifies the database (ensemble, havana...) and I think is correct to leave like that.
in the 9th column, In which rows (CDS, exon, gene, start_codon, stop_codon, transcript ...) do I have to put the gene_biotype ""protein_coding""?
Best,

Marco

From then on, chunks of line 572 and line 520 errors alternate till infinity.

I triple checked that all files are in their proper place and their path well indicated in the config file.

Could you give me some guidance?

Besides this, my gtf file is lacking the start_codon and stop_codon features, but according to this open issue https://github.com/pauline-ng/SIFT4G_Create_Genomic_DB/issues/6, the error for that should appear later on. Do you know any tool that automatically edits the annotation file to include start_codon and stop_codon features?

I am trying to create a database for a mammalian genome on RefSeq. The run time is quite long (several days), and occasionally the procedure fails due to various errors (out of memory, for instance). I am wondering if it would be okay to parallelize the database creation by running it independently for each chromosome/contig. Then, after all jobs have completed, I would keep the *.gz, *.regions, and *_SIFTDB_stats.txt from each <PARENT_DIR>/<ORG_VERSION>. Do you think this would be okay?

    Hi Isaac,

    I think I get it! Does this happen for a small fraction, like <1% of your synonymous variants?

    When a synonymous amino acid is predicted deleterious, this means the amino acid in the protein sequence is dissimilar to the other protein homologues in the protein alignment.

    The not so interesting explanation is that there  is sequencing error in the reference genome and the reference amino acid is incorrect. The alternative interesting explanation is the amino acid in the protein sequence in your organism has mutated away from the norm. This could indicate a pseudogene if there are lots of deleterious synonymous variants in a given gene. If it's a single amino acid change in a protein, I thought positive evolution would be a possibility, but that's pure speculation.

    We actually use the % of reference amino acids damanging as a QC.  For the human genome, 0.1% of the reference amino acid is predicted damaging. Here's an example:
    https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/sift4g/public//Homo_sapiens/GRCh37.74/2_SIFTDB_stats.txt

    Reference predictions % damaging: 0.1 2842/2341194

    This is generated for every chromosome in the <chr>_SIFTDB_stats.txt file

        Hi Pauline,

        My input vcf is the same for both VEP and SIFT. You are absolutely right. The issue is the sift prediction score. All output from both VEP and SIFT matches. For that particular case and a few hundred more, SIFT predicts them to be deleterious but they are all synonymous transcripts. Synonymous transcripts will not be deleterious. I ran sift with option -t, which means to  annotate with all transcripts"" All Nonsynonymous calls from SIFT match with VEP. It is really concerning and your help will be greatly appreciated. If you need any file to troubleshoot, I will gladly provide them

        Thanks

            Hi Isacc,

            The output of SIFT matches VEP for nonsynonymous annotation? So this is not a build problem. Sometimes, there are alternative scripts and SIFT picks the one with the lowest score. Have you tried running it with the ""annotate with all transcripts"" option?

            I am a little confused because in one email you say: ""Although I looked and it seemed like the region we looked at is a region of the genome with no gene."" and in another email it says ""SIFT matches the output from VEP with the same amino acid changes"". So the issue is SIFT prediction scores, and not the gene annotation?

                Given that I used the method of downloading data from Ensemble directly using the config file (see attached), I am positive it is not a genome build problem. Do you see any problem with my config file? The output from SIFT matches the output from VEP with the same amino acid changes except the SIFT called many synonymous variants deleterious. What else could be the issue?

                        I successfuly built a SIFT DB for soy. I ran vep and then ran SIFT4g. SIFT called the transcript synonymous and  deleterious, which may not be accurate. What do you think may have caused it? How does SIFT use the variant coordinates? Can there be an off by one error? Although I looked and it seemed like the region we looked at is a region of the genome with no gene. Do you also think it is an issue of SIFT not mapping the genomic location to the right transcript?

Hi @pauline-ng 
Once I run SIFT on my variant set, I see variant labelled as synonymous are predicted to be deleterious.
I understand why some amino acid changes would appear to be tolerated and others not.  But I don’t understand how SIFT predict that no amino acid change (synonymous variants) can be problematic (deleterious)
Will you please explain it to me?

Dear Pauline,

I'm running into some error messages (see at the end of this post) while creating my own SIFT database. The strangest thing is that I could see that files were being created in the singleRecords_with_scores folder, and they looked good, but after the programme is done running all contents from this folder are wiped out. I've attempted it once more with higher RAM in case memory was the problem, but I ran into the exact same issue (plus this time I also got warnings because all .fa files in the chr-src folder were already gzipped).

I can confirm there are neither ""X"" nor ""*"" characters (nor duplicate entries) in the all_prot.fasta file. However there are quite a few N characters in the .fa files (in case that matters).

Sorry if this issue has been reported before; I found two instances with similar error code, but they didn't help me.

Thank you very much for any help you may provide.

Best,

Daniel.

I have successfully created the trial human database but can’t create a mango database using NCBI genome and GFF file [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=txid29780[orgn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=txid29780%5borgn)]  

**GTF file**
I believe something is wrong with my GTF file but I’m unsure how to fix it (error code below).  Here is my GTF file and the GFF file that was used to create it. 
[GCF_011075055.1_CATAS_Mindica_2.1_genomic.gff.gz](https://github.com/pauline-ng/SIFT4G_Create_Genomic_DB/files/8347186/GCF_011075055.1_CATAS_Mindica_2.1_genomic.gff.gz)

This is what I have done:
1.	gene_biotype added: I have added = gene_biotype ""protein_coding"" to column 9 for CDS, exon and transcript (wasn’t sure about this one so tried both). 
2.	I don’t have start or stop codons in column 3 but I see you have “updated the SIFT code to no longer require start/stop codon coordinates in order to build a database.”
3.	I have checked read/write access with ls -l
4.	I have triple checked the folders are all in the right spot
5.	GFF vs GTF: In column 3, the GTF file only has exon, CDS and transcript, it’s missing the ‘gene’ that is in the GFF file (along with other categories e.g. region, tRNA). Was there something wrong with the conversion from GFF to GTF?

The code results in a folder called SIFT_predictions, with alignment fasta files. If I’ve understood it correctly those sequences are with Sw aligned, so pairwise and locally with the query sequence. The identity of the sequences are listed, but what about the query sequence? There is only the ID in the file name (i.e. : ENST000063518). 

1. Can you clarify how those ids come to be?
2. The sequences are aligned locally, so is it possible to get access to the full query sequence, just with its „ID“?
3. The SIFT.prediction files provide us with position specific sift scores for the newly constructed queries, how is this information significant to us? Can it be closed back to the original query? Or is the SIFT4g annotator the sole possibility to get position specific sift scores for the query sequence?

Thanks in advance,

I have a couple of questions regarding the protein alignment results.
If i have understood it correct, the queries(in SIFT_prediction folder) used in the files are acquired from the gtf file, right?
But they do vary from the sequences found in the gtf file. It seems, like there has been a sequence which has been inserted.

1. Can you explain to me or link me to an explanation on what change is done and how these sequences are created/chosen as query?
2. Also if the change that is done is just the longest increasing subsequence algorithm, then why does the start and end seem to not change?
3. Lastly, this Query sequence is locally pairwise aligned(SW) with the collected sequences and sift scores are calculated. But is this sequence, which is found in the files(*.aligned.fasta) the **whole** sequence? Because the whole sequence is aligned, it seems more like a global alignment.
For example as in here(Homo sapien file):

Thanks for developing this resource to create SIFT4G databases for any organism. It's quite easy to use. I am annotating a new bird genome, the Greater prairie chicken (Tympanuchus cupido). Unfortunately, my database statistics are quite low. When I use UniRef90 as the protein database, I get the following overall stats:

ALL     23 (4351/18874) 39 (16156279/41401234)  15(2441297/16156279)

I thought that maybe a larger database could help, so I tried using the ncbi non-redundant database, but that actually resulted in even worse statistics:

ALL     19 (3572/18874) 33 (13754937/41401234)  6(890807/13754937)

I started with a gff file, and used gffread to convert to gtf. I did not personally create the gff file, but it was created with Maker based on transcriptome data. I am not sure how to assess the quality of this gff. 

Do you have any ideas for how I could improve my overall SIFT database statistics on this organism? When I ran the test cases, I found very high database statistics, so I believe I am running everything correctly. I've pasted my config file below.

Best, 
Andrew

 I went through the tutorial on github and created my own database for mus_musculus GRCm39.106. I then compared it to the one you have online (GRCm38.83), and I noticed that:

1. for most chromosomes the newer version had heavier files, which I think makes sense because they updated the genome
2. In the one online, there are a total of 137 files in the folder while in the one I created there are only 119
3. When running SIFT4g with the new database on previously ran samples, I get fewer hits. For example, in one VCF I tested, the old database resulted in 53 sites in the output while the new one was only 39

I have attached screenshots of the errors I got during database creation. It seems that some files (not sure what these are), weren't in the directory, so couldn't be processed. I also compared the ""CHECK_GENES.LOG"" file and there are six more of these GL or JH files, so that accounts for the 18 missing files as each records gets three files. My questions are:

1. what are these files and how are they important?
2. Any idea why I am missing six from the new assembly?

One suspicion I had was that my internet connection was too slow when downloading the ensembl files that maybe some were left out. I am planning to repeat at a place where I have better internet to test this. But I also wanted to check if you had any additional ideas.",pauline-ng,https://github.com/pauline-ng/SIFT4G_Create_Genomic_DB/issues/63,pauline-ng++SIFT4G_Create_Genomic_DB.csv

I've created a SIFT database for chromosome 3 of Dictyostelium discoideum using fasta and gff (converted to gtf) files. Running `more CHECK_GENES.LOG` gave the output:

`Started Running .......`

Both of my genes of interest seem to have been included in the various files produced for the alignment. I did not include the vcf file during in the 'dbSNP' file during the database creation process, so could this be the issue? If so, is there a way to create the SIFT database using several VCF files or a merged VCF file containing SNP information for different strains of an organism with different SNPs within the same gene sequence, as I wish to look at a few hundred VCF files and the SNP effects on protein structure.

I have had errors in attempting to create a database for rheMac10 (or MMul_10). There already is a database for rheMac8 (MMul_8) for some reference. I have my own FASTA reference and gtf file and have successfully created a test database for the homo-sapiens_test provided as an examples in test_files. I've allowed the program to run in excess of 24 hours so I think I've gotten the maximal output possible so far.

I'll try my best to describe the errors and give my output and config. The latter should differ only from homo_sapiens-test.txt in the following lines:

PARENT_DIR=/home/npb0015/reinforcement_project/
ORG=macaca_mulatta
ORG_VERSION=Mmul_10.99

#Running SIFT 4G

# Sub-directories, don't need to change
GENE_DOWNLOAD_DEST=Reference_files/
CHR_DOWNLOAD_DEST=Reference_files/

The error messages I receive are the following two lines repeated several times:

Use of uninitialized value $aa in string eq at make-single-records-BIOPERL.pl line 274.
Use of uninitialized value $aa in concatenation (.) or string at make-single-records-BIOPERL.pl line 280.

Then the following repeated several times:

Use of uninitialized value $orig_aa in string eq at make-single-records-BIOPERL.pl line 551.
Use of uninitialized value $mutated_aa in string eq at make-single-records-BIOPERL.pl line 551.

Then the following repeated several times:

Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at make-single-records-BIOPERL.pl line 305.

And are are at least a hundred thousand blocks like that. Then later on blocks of the following repeated:

Use of uninitialized value $mutated_aa in string eq at generate-fasta-subst-files-BIOPERL.pl line 894
Use of uninitialized value $aa2 in string eq at generate-fasta-subst-files-BIOPERL.pl line 621.
Use of uninitialized value $aa2 in string ne at generate-fasta-subst-files-BIOPERL.pl line 626.

When the program is done it seems to populate singleRecords, subst, and fasta folders with a substantive number of files looking correct. The main folder is populated with log files and the Reference_files directory does have txt files. All other directories in the config file and particularly the Mmul_10.99 is never populated. When I annotated a VCF using the directory it seems as though there's no SIFT annotations occuring.

I hope this has been sufficiently detailed and would greatly appreciate help.",npb596,https://github.com/pauline-ng/SIFT4G_Create_Genomic_DB/issues/70,pauline-ng++SIFT4G_Create_Genomic_DB.csv

I have wanted to use SIFT4G on the 11th chromosome of homo sapiens. 
To do that I am in need of a proper gene annotation file, so I used as suggested the SIFT4G Annotator.
The files I've used are basically the provided Database (https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/sift4g/public/Homo_sapiens/GRCh38.83.chr/11.gz), 
and as for the .vcf file, I used variants provided by clinvar, trimmed for only the 11th chromosome.

I will include the vcf file (in two halfs and .txt) as a attachment. 

To get the gene annotation file, I have used the .jar graphical board as well, as the command option on linux
(java -jar SIFT4G_Annotator.jar -c -i annotator/eleven.vcf -d 11 -r annotator -t)

**The procedure results in empty files and such an answer:**

It seems that I got the same result, but for my research object ,it takes about 30 minutes to making the database, it takes so short time that I can't believe it all done.

Any advice?

So it has to be accessible for the program?

I have a question about using reference genome to build my SIFT database.
I have two species (SP1 and SP2, for example). SP1 has a reference genome, while SP2 does not. SNP calling for both species is based on SP1's genome.
My question is: can I use SP1's genome to build my SIFT database and then annotate VCF files for both species? Or should I only annotate SP1, while SP2 needs its own reference genome?
My aim is to compare the number of deleterious sites between the two species.
Maybe it's a very simple question. But I'm really confused as I don't understand the calculation theory well.
Thanks in advance for your attention and time.

I have been trying to use make-SIFT-db-all.pl to create a database. It all seems to be going well, and files are being created in the directories singleRecords, fasta and subst (the others are empty). However, I get an email saying the slurm job has failed. It says 'Exit code 255', usually after 11h-12h of run at the step of "" Aligning queries with candidate sequences "". Last time it advanced until: 

** Aligning queries with candidate sequences **
... processing database part 1 (size ~1.00 GB): 47.50/100.00% 

It doesn't seem to be a memory problem, as the jobs are using less memory than I requested. Any suggestion of what can happening?

Below is the config file I'm using. 

Thank you very much for your help!

Best wishes,
Clarissa-

I am trying to build a SIFT database for a strain of Neisseria gonorrhoeae that unfortunately is not present in EnsemblBacteria. I am using the gtf and chromosome files from the NCBI (from [here](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/013/030/075/GCF_013030075.1_ASM1303007v1/)) but I keep running into the same error when trying to build the database. I've pasted the output below, but essentially when I look at the fasta.log file I get a message saying: ""0 out of 2283 translated to sequences that start with M and end with *"". 

I've manually checked and at least the first 2 sequences based on the gtf coordinates should work. I've double checked that the names match up between my chromosome file and my gtf file, I've double checked that they are using proper linux end of line characters, and I've made sure that my chromosome file is uncompressed and my gtf file is gzipped. 

I've looked through any issues here I can find that look similar, one suggested adding in an exon line since NCBI gtfs don't have an exon tag, I tried that as well and no luck. I am deleting all of the generated files in the directory between each try. I am able to run both of the test cases without issues, so I think this must be some kind of file compatibility issue?

Thanks,
Duncan

May I check if the human database is created okay? 

Secondly, I'm unable to load the [SIFT4G databases](https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/sift4g/) to counter-check. Wondering if there's any issues with the web-site?

Thank you so much for cath-tools-genomescan, I've found it very useful so far.  

I was running `cath-genomscan.pl` on all of the genes predicted in my metagenome samples. It was taking quite a while, mostly due to `hmmsearch`, which despite the default behavior to use all available cpus usually only uses a few.  I wanted to figure out how to parallelize it and came up with this strategy. 

1) added an argument to `hmmsearch` in `cath-genomescan.pl` to only use 1 cpu (`'--cpu 1'`)
2) split my amino acid fasta files into the number of cpus I wanted to use (in this case 48)
3) wrote the `cath-genomescan.pl` commands for each of the sub files to a text file
4) submitted that text file to be run in parallel (cpus=48)

This seemed to work pretty well and got the results I was looking for very quickly.  I of course had to clean up some intermediate files and parse/aggregate the results into single files.  I figured I'd share the strategy.  Not sure how easily it can be implemented for `cath-genomescan.pl`, but at least providing an argument to set the number of cpus used by `hmmsearch` could be helpful.  

Here is the nasty bash code I used inside a loop over my directories.  Tried to clean up a little to make it easier to read.
```
#get the headers from the faa file 
      grep ""^>"" min1000_faa > min1000_faa_headers.txt
#split into 48 chunks
      split --number=l/48 min1000_faa_headers.txt --additional-suffix=_headers_split
#remove the leading "">"" from the headers 
      sed -i 's/>//g' *_headers_split
#for each of the header chunks 
      for i in *_headers_split;
      do
#use pullseq to get the aa sequences for each chunk (https://github.com/bcthomas/pullseq)
        pullseq -i $min1000_faa -n $i > $i.faa
#append the cath-genomescan.pl command for that chunk to a text file
        echo ""/path/to/cath-tools-genomescan/apps/cath-genomescan.pl -i $PWD/$i.faa -l path/to/cath-tools-genomescan/data/funfam-hmm3.lib -o $PWD/$i.faa.out"" >> cath_genomescan_cluster_commands.txt
      done
#now send the cath-genomescan.pl commands to parallel with 48 cpus and pipe to qsub to submit to the cluster 
echo ""parallel -j48 < $PWD/cath_genomescan_cluster_commands.txt"" | qsub -V -N cath_${sample}
```

Following the example here (https://github.com/UCLOrengoGroup/cath-tools-genomescan) to get the EC numbers and GO terms for a CATH FunFam model. With the test data, when I run `./apps/retrieve_FunFam_aln_GO_anno_CATH-API.pl 2.40.50.140/FF/58874 v4_1_0` in my project directory I get the following error `-bash: ./apps/retrieve_FunFam_aln_GO_anno_CATH-API.pl: No such file or directory`. 

Looking at `retrieve_FunFam_aln_GO_anno_CATH-API.pl` this makes sense, since on line 34 it seems to have a 'results' directory hardcoded to be in the parent directory of the current directory.  It also seems to be looking for `*.sto.aln` and `*.GO.anno` files there that I can't figure out where they would have been produced.  

On line 42 it does seem to construct a correct url to download the stockholm alignment file for the given FunFam and this file does contain the EC and GO metadata (as well as other useful information).  

As I have run `cath-genomescan.pl` on all of the proteins predicted in my metagenome, it seemed very inefficient for me and the CATH API server to query the server for the redundant set of CATH FunFams, so I generated a non-redundant list and downloaded all of the stockholm files for those.  I've been working on parsing out the metadata I am interested in, but keep hitting little text formatting and things I wasn't expecting...

Maybe I'm just incapable of finding it, but Is here is a table somewhere on the FTP (ftp://orengoftp.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/cath/releases/latest-release/) that has the CATH superfamily IDs, FunFam IDs, and associated ECs and GOs (maybe even accessions, definitions, descriptions, but that could be a bit much...)?  It would be really useful for users and might save some unnecessary traffic downloading thousands of alignments just to get the metadata.  I noticed in several publications (DOI 10.1093/nar/gkv488, 10.1093/bioinformatics/btv398) that the ability to connect FunFams to ECs is a feature of the FunFams, I've just had a hard time doing it efficiently and programmatically.

can you comment on this? (BTW I installed a macOS version of HMMER. Could that be causing the problem?)

Thank you for having your repeat library construction pipeline public, it has been super helpful!

I have one question regarding the protocol: I have been successful in identifying MITEs in my fungal genome, and I have proceeded to identify LTRs. However, when I try to identify candidate elements for recent LTRs, the resulting gff99 file is empty, so I cannot go forward. I assumed that was because perhaps my data-set didn't have any, but I am not sure if this is true (there were not any errors reported). I then moved on to identified older LTRs, which produced a gff85 with data.
At some point in the pipeline, we need to run: 
perl ${DIR_CRL}/cleanRM.pl ${PREFIX}.outinner85.out ${PREFIX}.outinner85.masked > ${PREFIX}.outinner85.unmasked

However, in my case this does not work because i had no 99 output and it seems that cleanRM.pl requires it. So, I am confused as to how to proceed, which are my unmasked and cleaned files?

Thank you so much!

MDU6SXNzdWUzNjUxNzE4MzQ=,Confirm that use of BLAST's `-max_target_seqs` is intentional,OPEN,2018-09-29T22:25:03Z,2018-09-29T22:25:03Z,,"Hi there,

This is a semi-automated message from a fellow bioinformatician. Through a GitHub search, I found that the following source files make use of BLAST's `-max_target_seqs` parameter: 

- [assembly-scripts/blastx-nr.sh](https://github.com/bethsheets/Population-Genomics-via-RNAseq/blob/178296217dd0da1c625a836589a94ae59b47876e/assembly-scripts/blastx-nr.sh)

- [assembly-scripts/example_tBLASTx_localdb_customout_mkm.sbatch](https://github.com/bethsheets/Population-Genomics-via-RNAseq/blob/178296217dd0da1c625a836589a94ae59b47876e/assembly-scripts/example_tBLASTx_localdb_customout_mkm.sbatch)

Based on the recently published report, [Misunderstood parameter of NCBI BLAST impacts the correctness of bioinformatics workflows](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty833/5106166?redirectedFrom=fulltext), there is a strong chance that this parameter is misused in your repository.

If the use of this parameter was intentional, please feel free to ignore and close this issue but I would highly recommend to add a comment to your source code to notify others about this use case. If this is a duplicate issue, please accept my apologies for the redundancy as this simple automation is not smart enough to identify such issues.

Thank you!

(Comprehensive gene annotation, CHG region) then I load it into R with GenomicFeature using this:
`gencode_v19 = makeTxDbFromGFF(gtfFile,
                    format = 'gtf',
                    dataSource = 'gencode',
                    organism = 'Homo sapiens',
                    chrominfo = chromInfo)`
I extract 5'UTR and 3'UTR using fiveUTRsByTranscript() and threeUTRsByTranscript() like this:
`utr5 = fiveUTRsByTranscript(gencode_v19,use.names=TRUE)`
But the UTR I get is  slightly different from UTR annotation in gencode v19 gtf file. It seems that GenomicFeatures doesn't regard stop codon  as part of 3'UTR. Here is an example: ENST00000370584. Is this right ? If it's right, where should I change in raw codes to include stop codon when calculate 3'UTR ? 
Also total UTR regions (the sum of 5'UTR and 3'UTR) generated by GenomicFeatures is only 280400 while total UTR regions in gtf file is 284573. I use the following steps to count UTR regions generated by GenomicFeatures. Let's regard utr5 and utr3 as the result of fiveUTRsByTranscript() and threeUTRsByTranscript() respectively. Then I transform utr5 and utr3 to dataframe with as.data.frame() and use nrow() to count UTR regions. I count UTR regions in gencode gtf files simply using `awk '$3~/UTR/{print}' gencode.v19.gtf | wc -l `. I think this two number should be the same but apparently they are not. So why is there small difference ?

Sorry for bad test data, made this quickly:

tx is a GRangesList of 100.000 transcripts:
ranges is 600.000 ORFs on the transcripts as IRanges
orfs$index is the index for each orf which transcript it came from

See how the time is different:
1. Without names:

```
grl <- tx 
names(grl) <- NULL
system.time(pmapFromTranscripts(x = ranges, transcripts = grl[orfs$index]))
   user  system elapsed 
 19.661   1.701  21.355 

```
2. With names:

```
grl <- tx
system.time(pmapFromTranscripts(x = ranges, transcripts = grl[orfs$index]))
   user  system elapsed 
 74.474   3.616  78.071 
```

3. Without names, and set them afterwards, so result is same as 2. 
```
names(grl) <- NULL
system.time({genomic <- pmapFromTranscripts(x = ranges, transcripts = grl[orfs$index]);
                     names(genomic) <- names(tx)[orfs$index] })
   user  system elapsed 
 19.963   1.634  21.591 
```

So this means that 2. is almost 4 times slower, while we could have done  3 , which is as fast a 1. 

Is this intentional ?

MDU6SXNzdWU0MDMzOTk1Nzg=,Question: error in makeTxDbFromUCSC,CLOSED,2019-01-26T03:18:33Z,2019-01-28T06:04:00Z,2019-01-28T04:58:50Z,"Hi GenomicFeatures support,

I am a phD student at the University of Tokyo, using GenomicFeatures for ChIPSeeker. 

After I run
txdb=makeTxDbFromUCSC(genome=""hg19"",tablename=""refGene"")

I got this error.

Download the refGene table ... OK
Download the hgFixed.refLink table ... OK
Extract the 'transcripts' data frame ... OK
Extract the 'splicings' data frame ... OK
Download and preprocess the 'chrominfo' data frame ... OK
Prepare the 'metadata' data frame ... OK
**Make the TxDb object ... Error in .check_foreign_key(transcripts_tx_chrom, NA, ""transcripts$tx_chrom"",  : 
  all the values in 'transcripts$tx_chrom' must be present in 'chrominfo$chrom'**

**I consider the problem is that refGene version was upgraded last November,however, GenomicFeatures haven't done corresponding changes to the new refGene release.**

I googled it and it pointed me to connector/c libs in MariaDb. On Debian I have libmariadb-dev 10.3.13 and libmariadb-dev-compat 10.3.13 installed. On Arch I have mariadb-libs 10.3.14 installed. I am not using RMariaDb directly and do not intend to.
I installed github version of RMariaDb, now the error message changed slightly:
```

Download the knownGene table ... Error: Error fetching buffer:

```
I have also installed github version of Bioconductor/GenomicFeatures. It did not change anything
I ran out of ideas. Is there a workaroud? Can I use sqlite instead?

http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_release/term/SO:0001217

which indicates that protein_coding_gene is a valid feature at the same level as ncRNA_gene and pseudogene.

I can see this being addressed either in the code -- by adding protein_coding_gene as a 'gene' equivalent -- or in the documentation to make it clear what the expected ontology is.",cmatKhan,https://github.com/Bioconductor/GenomicFeatures/issues/33,Bioconductor++GenomicFeatures.csv

When trying to use `getPromoterSeq()`, I received the following error:

```
Error in value[[3L]](cond) : 
   record 6097 (CP022322.1:-380-19) was truncated
  file: /home/chase/projects/brentlab/kn99_database/genome_files/kn99/KN99_fungiDB/FungiDB-53_CneoformansKN99_Genome.fasta
```

Upon inspecting the promoter regions with the same setting , `upstream = 400`, as I had used in `getPromoterSeq`, I discovered that there are two genes which, with this promoter definition, return negative values due to the fact that they are annotated at the very beginning of the chromosome such that 400bp upstream causes the promoter range to be returned as a negative value:

```
> promoters[promoters@ranges@start < 0]

                      seqnames    ranges strand |     tx_id           tx_name

```

I confirmed that this was, in fact, the cause of the error in  `getPromoterSeq()` by setting `upstream` to 20 or less, so that no negative values are returned, and  `getPromoterSeq()` returned without error.

Possibly in the `promoters` function, a warning should be issued? Alternatively, if the definition of the promoter places the upstream/downstream indicies out of range of the chromosome, maybe setting to the chromosome limit (0 or length(chromosome)) would be appropriate? Maybe this should be an argument, something like, `handle_out_of_bound_indicies = TRUE` by default?",cmatKhan,https://github.com/Bioconductor/GenomicFeatures/issues/40,Bioconductor++GenomicFeatures.csv

I want to use extractTranscriptSeqs to extract the CDS sequence corresponding to SNP and get the corresponding protein sequence, and the following is my code:
```
ref_genome <- BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38

cds<-cdsBy(txdb, by=""tx"", use.names=TRUE)
extractcds<-extractTranscriptSeqs(alt_genome,cds)

I found that if I do this, the final sequence will have many non-bases, such as ""R"", ""W"", ""S"", etc. I don't understand what kind of information these letters represent? How should I modify the code if I want to use the translate function of Biostrings?

[For gene-wise GRanges input, the TSS is the first (i.e. most upstream) of all transcript-wise TSSs.]

Given a list of transcripts of gene (ensembl IDs such as ENSTxxx and ENSGxxx), I wish to find all TSS within that gene and subsequently group transcripts sharing a common TSS.

I was trying to make txdb object from `AnnotationHub` Ensembl releases using the  `makeTxDbFromEnsembl` function, as this is what I thought this function did from its description line.

> The makeTxDbFromEnsembl function creates a TxDb object for a given organism by importing the genomic locations of its transcripts, exons, CDS, and genes from an Ensembl database.

```r
ens106 = AnnotationHub::AnnotationHub()[[""AH100643""]]
txdb = GenomicFeatures::makeTxDbFromEnsembl(ens106)
# Error in .normarg_organism(organism) : 'organism' must be a single string
```

Reading the documentation more carefully (hence the edit), I realize that this function is not supposed to work on `AnnotationHub` objects.

However, would it make sense to provide this functionality?

Incorrect annotations are returned when calling a VariantAnnotation function (`locateVariants()` with  `region = IntronVariants()` ) that internally uses `mapToTranscripts` .  

I believe this error is caused by passing a list containing some empty transcripts to the `transcripts` argument of `mapToTranscripts()`.  This can be fixed by removing the empty transcripts, but perhaps it might be useful to signal an error to the user in this condition or handle this internally? As far as i can tell, the erroneous mapping occurs in the `.orderElementsByTranscription` function.

Here is a reprex using the example provided on the support site and an example of how  `.orderElementsByTranscription` will reorder/duplicate transcripts in the presence of empty list elements. 

``` r
library(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene)
library(GenomicFeatures)
txdb <- TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene

# generate a grl with some zero length entries
grl <- intronsByTranscript(txdb)
sum(elementNROWS(grl) == 0)
#> [1] 10556

gr <- GRanges(seqnames = ""chr5"",
              ranges = IRanges(start = 20298238,
                               end = 20298238))
genome(gr) <- ""hg19""

tx <- mapToTranscripts(gr, grl)
tx

## looks like .orderElementsByTranscription changes the order of elements 
## in the `grl` list when zero-length elements are in grl?
## e.g. the transcript in grl[[7]] != the transcript in ord_grl[[7]]

I_kwDOBhavs85g6rUr,Add 'genome' argument to makeTxDbFromGFF(),CLOSED,2023-03-15T17:50:34Z,2024-03-23T00:41:55Z,2024-03-23T00:41:55Z,"### Edit: All `makeTxDb*()` functions have moved to the new **txdbmaker** package. So I re-created this issue [there](https://github.com/Bioconductor/txdbmaker/issues/2) and I'm closing this one.

Right now (as of **GenomicFeatures** 1.51.4) `makeTxDbFromGFF()` produces a TxDb object that has an unspecified genome by default. To change this, one needs to explicitely set the genome on the TxDb object returned by `makeTxDbFromGFF()`, e.g. with `genome(txdb) <- ""T2T-CHM13v2.0""` (it's important to use the official name of the assembly otherwise the `seqlevelsStyle()` setter won't be able to switch the sequence naming style to UCSC or RefSeq). Alternatively one can specify the genome at creation time with `makeTxDbFromGFF(..., metadata=data.frame(name=""Genome"", value=""T2T-CHM13v2.0""))` but this is admitedly poorly documented and not very convenient.

So let's add a `genome` argument to `makeTxDbFromGFF()`.

I_kwDOBhavs85ieFBB,`makeTxDbFromGFF` fails with (bacterial) genome GTF files from NCBI,CLOSED,2023-04-03T13:14:10Z,2024-03-23T00:45:45Z,2024-02-01T13:13:27Z,"Dear maintainers, I noticed recently that making a Txdb object from a GFF (or GTF) file from bacteria can be difficult.
I downloaded several genome assemblies from the NCBI genomes website, all of them the reference genomes for widely used model bacteria such as Salmonella or Bacillus. When I try to make the txdb object, the function throws the following error:

```
> GenomicFeatures::makeTxDbFromGFF("".../genomes/s_enterica/GCF_000006945.2/genomic.gtf"")

Import genomic features from the file as a GRanges object ... OK
Prepare the 'metadata' data frame ... OK
Make the TxDb object ... Error in .make_splicings(exons, cds, stop_codons) : 
  some CDS cannot be mapped to an exon
In addition: Warning message:
In .get_cds_IDX(mcols0$type, mcols0$phase) :
  The ""phase"" metadata column contains non-NA values for features of type
  stop_codon. This information was ignored.
```

The problem here seems that there are some underlying assumptions about the structure of genes. Bacteria don't have exons, so ideally the function should not throw an error when exon information is missing. Also, bacteria can have multiple CDS on one transcript (operon structure), I'm not sure if this is also related to the error above. I am willing to make a PR to fiy this bug if I know where to look for.

Thank you!

I_kwDOBhavs85lM-He,`makeTxDbFromBiomart()` on the Ensembl archive version failed ,CLOSED,2023-05-05T16:42:48Z,2024-02-01T18:02:45Z,2024-02-01T18:02:45Z,"Hi there,
I'm having trouble with `makeTxDbFromBiomart()` on the archive version of the Ensembl Plant.

I hope to use a older version of maize genome at *https://nov2020-plants.ensembl.org*. Below is my function call:

```r
zmv4_txdb <- makeTxDbFromBiomart(dataset=""zmays_eg_gene"", 
                             biomart=""plants_mart"",
                             host=""https://nov2020-plants.ensembl.org"")
zmv4_txdb
```

Although it says **Ensembl Plants Genes 49** which uses **RefGen_v4**, the content is actually the newest version from **Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0** (as you can see below). I wonder how to let `makeTxDbFromBiomart()` work on the older version of Ensembl Plant if possible?

```

The search call returned the correct version.

And it gives the same number as txdb from gtf file.

I am having some issues creating a TxDb object for susScr11 (Pig, 2017). I have used makeTxDbFromUCSC in the past to create a TxDb object for this genome, but on a different device. I didn't run into any issues there, but I am now no longer able to create a TxDb for susScr11.

`makeTxDbFromUCSC(genome=""susScr11"")` returns the error ""Error in normArgTrack(track, trackids) : 'track' must be a single string.""

`supportedUCSCtables(genome=""susScr11"")` returns only one entry under the _tablename_ variable: knownGene, and both the 'track' and 'subtrack' values for this are ""NA"".

I'm not sure what happened in the interim between when I initially created a TxDb for susScr11 ~12 months ago without issue, but I would really appreciate some guidance on this. For what it's worth, I attempted to create a TxDb using the older pig genomes available from USCS, and the same outputs resulted.

I_kwDOBhavs85ySjxt,Installation requires vctrs (≥ 0.6.0),CLOSED,2023-09-28T12:43:08Z,2023-10-02T17:41:20Z,2023-10-02T17:41:20Z,"Hey,
I install this package as part of a package that I'm developing.
Until recently, this was not an issue.
However, in the last few days, I encounter errors due to vctrs (≥ 0.6.0) (see attached screenshot).
This was a surprise to me since your package does not require vctrs directly. I looked for the actual problem and I think it rises from the installation of dplyr (ver. 1.1.3). Older version did not require vctrs (≥ 0.6.0) so I didn't have this issue. I still don't understand why dplyr (ver. 1.1.3) is even required since you don't mention it in the dependencies.

Please help me figuring this out.
Thanks

I see that there are some recent changes from last week. I looked at changes and it seems that there is a new packlage 'txdbmaker' with a redirection to functions from that package.

@hpages Should I fix it in those packages or is this something you would like to address?
Thanks for any advice on how to fix this issue long term best.

I'm using 1.54.1, but the relevant code hasn't haven in 1.56 or in txdbmaker

```
txdb <- GenomicFeatures::makeTxDbFromEnsembl('homo_sapiens')
Error: Failed to connect: Unknown database 'homo_sapiens_core_112_37'
```

The issue appears to be in `GenomicFeatures:::.lookup_dbname_fix`. It loads the cor_dirs from the FTP which contains ...core_37 and core_38

```
core_dirs <- Ensembl_listMySQLCoreDirs(mysql_url, release = release)
.... ""homo_sapiens_core_112_37"". ""homo_sapiens_core_112_38""   ....
```

It then uses match to pick the first value, which is `homo_sapiens_core_112_37`:
```
i <- match(prefix, substr(core_dirs, 1L, nchar(prefix)))
```

But this is not a valid database for `makeTxDbFromEnsembl`. Replacing the DB with `homo_sapiens_core_112_38` manually, or replacing the above line with the following to choose the later value fixes the issue 
```
i <- max(which(prefix == substr(core_dirs, 1L, nchar(prefix))))

2. in the barcode_search function

`if header_line.split('\t')[count].strip() == 'Assembly Barcode':`

I alter the line looking for the Data Source column header to mirror what was in the my downloaded file:

Question 1: The tutorial says a python script is used to remove reads classified as contaminants, but it is not clear if that script uses any particular threshold level of contamination, or simply removes any read marked as classified. If it simply removes all classified reads, is the output from using the --un-gz option (save unclassified reads to gzip-compressed file) equivalent?
Question 2: Is there a risk of removing too much data? A single 50-nt match might occur by chance in a highly-conserved coding sequence (e.g. histones for eukaryotic species) to create false-positive hits that don't really reflect contamination.

A more complete solution would query the tree to find subtree roots, then use python multiprocessing to run fill in parallel before joining the subtrees with a `max_depth` parameter automatically set to the depth of the subtree roots.

1. **taxonID - gbif id, use ""GBIF<taxonID>"" as alt_taxon_id if no NCBI match/synonym found**
2. datasetID - ignore for now for GenomeHubs
3. **parentNameUsageID - parent taxon id to establish parent-child links**; An identifier for the name usage of the direct, most proximate higher-rank parent taxon (in a classification) of the most specific element of the scientificName
4. **acceptedNameUsageID - Use to establish synonyms**; An identifier for the name usage of the currently valid (zoological) or accepted (botanical) taxon.
5. **originalNameUsageID - Use this to establish synonyms**; An identifier for the name usage in which the terminal element of the scientificName was originally established under the rules of the associated nomenclaturalCode
6. scientificName - use to manually resolve conflicts; The full scientific name, with authorship and date information if known
7. scientificNameAuthorship - use to manually resolve conflicts; The authorship information for the scientificName formatted according to the conventions of the applicable nomenclaturalCode
8. **canonicalName - Use this for comparing to NCBI names/synonyms** . The canonical form of the name. This form has no authorship or more than 3 name parts. 
9. genericName - Ignore for now for GenomeHubs
10. specificEpithet - Ignore for now for GenomeHubs; The name of the first or species epithet of the scientificName.
11. infraspecificEpithet - Ignore for now for GenomeHubs; The name of the lowest or terminal infraspecific epithet of the scientificName, excluding any rank designation
12. **taxonRank**
13. nameAccordingTo - Ignore for now for GenomeHubs; The reference to the source in which the specific taxon concept circumscription is defined or implied - traditionally signified by the Latin ""sensu"" or ""sec."" (from secundum, meaning ""according to""). For taxa that result from identifications, a reference to the keys, monographs, experts and other sources should be given.
14. namePublishedIn - Ignore for now for GenomeHubs; A reference for the publication in which the scientificName was originally established under the rules of the associated nomenclaturalCode.
15. **taxonomicStatus**
16. nomenclaturalStatus
17. taxonRemarks
18. **kingdom**
19. **phylum**
20. **class**
21. **order**
22. **family**
23. **genus**

In an ideal world the only thing for an attribute in a FILE yaml would be things specific to the file such as
```
header: 
separator: 
```
but when I run it this way, it gives me a 'type' error.

Example:
```

```
So I put type: in the FILE*yaml too:
```
header: 
separator: 
type: 
```
and now it runs fine.

Am guessing that’s not by design because I think type should be set once per attribute.

I'm trying to implement scatter, with a CLI API:

```bash
goat-cli taxon scatter -x assembly_span -y gc_percent -t Eukaryota -u

All good. Returns what I think it the URL should return as well:

```txt

```

But! It does not return the TSV I expect.

Try:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' ""https://goat.genomehubs.org/api/v2/report?result=taxon&includeEstimates=false&summaryValues=count&taxonomy=ncbi&report=table&y=gc_percent&rank=species&x=tax_tree%28lamiales%29%20and%20assembly_span"" -H ""accept: text/tab-separated-values""
```

JSON looks good to me though:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' ""https://goat.genomehubs.org/api/v2/report?result=taxon&includeEstimates=false&summaryValues=count&taxonomy=ncbi&report=table&y=gc_percent&rank=species&x=tax_tree%28lamiales%29%20and%20assembly_span"" -H ""accept: application/json""

I could implement something my side to parse the JSON but I presume this will want to be fixed for future?

They would like to display bars for each taxon side by side, instead of having the taxon names as categories.

I was not able to get there with available types of reports.
- The best I came up with then was to generate [2 histograms side by side](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fEZAnvzAWA8jcHkTT5uTsSkKXQ7wrj941npGKYpRuQU/edit) to compare the data.

**Is it possible to create a single report to compare across a taxonomic level?** 
-how many out of a projects target list have reach a specific status?

In my head it would work somewhat like:
- pick a tax_tree (e.g. Chiroptera)
- set the xField to a particular category like tax_rank (e.g. Families - in the case of Chiroptera will have around 20 bins)
- set the max Y as the count of one attribute (e.g. long_list=dtol and tax_rank(species)
- set the real Y as the nested attribute (e.g. sample_acquired=dtol and tax_rank(species))
- (these last 2 would appear as a xInY report, but displayed as a single bar

Some suggestions: from the users also included:
- an arc report that would report xPerTaxon instead of xPerRank
- The total would be normalised to % to allow a rainbow plot regardless of total",ccaio,https://github.com/genomehubs/genomehubs/issues/312,genomehubs++genomehubs.csv

I found an error and a workaround. 

On some machines the pre-compiled library of mira throws an error in the log file:

```

quick option baits reads from provided reference in iteration 0

fishing readpool using mirabait (k = 31)

mirabait: loadlocale.c:130: _nl_intern_locale_data: Assertion `cnt < (sizeof (_nl_value_type_LC_TIME) / sizeof (_nl_value_type_LC_TIME[0]))' failed.

your readpool does not contain any reads with reasonable match (k = 31) to your reference - Maybe you ll want to try different settings or even a different reference?

```

I investigated further and it seems like this is a known bug reported on the mira sourceforge page [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/mira-assembler/tickets/40/). [Bastien Chevreux](https://sourceforge.net/u/bach/profile/) the author of MIRA wrote 

```
A bug of the C++ libraries which I learned to circumvent in later versions of MIRA. Should you insist on using 4.0.2, the workaround is:
export LC_ALL=C
in the shell, then it will work.

For the time being, I recommend modifying `mtGenome_Assembly_Nick.R`:

MDU6SXNzdWU3MzUwODMwMTA=,Difficulties to use databases running BLAST,CLOSED,2020-11-03T07:18:36Z,2020-11-25T00:16:38Z,2020-11-25T00:16:38Z,"Do you need to create databases or is there a better option?

I created a database for copepods:

```
makeblastdb -in ../blastpacope/genomas_copepods/ncbi_dataset/data/db_all_copepods.fna -dbtype nucl -parse_seqids -out my_refrence2.fa
```
But they weigh a lot and running the BLAST is very slow.

To run BLAST use: 

```
blastn -db my_refrence2.fa -query ../blastpacope/minion/minion_carmen.fa -out results_allgenomes_tab.out -outfmt ""6 sframe qseqid sseqid evalue pident mismatch"" 
```
The function `-outfmt ""6 <options>""` shows results in a tab separated table.  And although it's hard to see, the line of identity percentage in general it looks higher than 80%, so I think that maybe it is not so contaminated, however, I think it makes a BLAST with many databases it will take longer and be more difficult, so I would like to know if anyone knows a more easier way to run BLAST?

Or if it will be a better option to start testing assemblers with different parameters?

MDU6SXNzdWU3Nzg2ODYxMzg=,denovo_map.pl: Aborted because the last command failed (Error: Unable to load data),OPEN,2021-01-05T07:44:54Z,2021-01-05T16:00:15Z,,"My problem is that I can't finish running **[denovo_map.pl.](https://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/comp-v1/denovo_map.php)**

I am using stacks on my local computer from a docker container with the following script [stacks.denovo_map.prueba.sh](https://github.com/JavierUrban/Genome-assembly-of-the-copepod-Leptodiaptomus/blob/main/bin/stacks.denovo_map.prueba.sh)

**denovomap.pl** is a program that is used to construct loci and to call SNPs de novo, this is used when there is no reference genome.

I want to run `denovo_map.pl` to identify SNPs in 93 samples with 23 and 22 individuals from 4 populations, but before I wanted to perform a test with 3 individuals from each population but I could not finish the process for these samples the program starts to run, but when you with to continue the analysis of sample 2, the process stops and displays an aborted message: `denovo_map.pl: Aborted because the last command failed (1); see log file.`

I first ran [`process_radtags`](https://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/comp/process_radtags.php), this is a program that checks the raw data from illumina and demultiplexes the samples for quality and cutoff sites of the restriction enzymes

I run the command as follows:

```
stacks process_radtags -P -p ../stacks/isuue2/GBS_raw/ --interleaved \
-b ../stacks/isuue2/barcodes_copes_iss.tsv -o ../stacks/isuue2/process_map_res/ \
-c -q -r --index_index --renz_1 mspI --renz_2 nsiI
```
The following image is an example of the raw data format and this is the [barcode file](https://github.com/JavierUrban/Genome-assembly-of-the-copepod-Leptodiaptomus/blob/main/meta-data/barcodes_copes_iss.tsv) that I use.

The output of `process_radtags` generates 4 different files .1 and .2 which are used to run` denovo_map.pl`

And then run `denovo_map.pl`:

```
stacks denovo_map.pl --samples ../stacks/isuue2/process_map_res/ \
--popmap ../stacks/isuue2/popmap_tarea_issue.tsv -o ../stacks/isuue2/denovo_map_re2 \
-M 3 -n 2 -m 3 -X ""populations: -r 0.50 --min_maf 0.01 --genepop""

```
Here is the [population map](https://github.com/JavierUrban/Genome-assembly-of-the-copepod-Leptodiaptomus/blob/main/meta-data/popmap_tarea_issue.tsv) file i use

And the following happens, showing the following message: **denovo_map.pl: Aborted because the last command failed (1); [see log file.](https://github.com/JavierUrban/Genome-assembly-of-the-copepod-Leptodiaptomus/blob/main/meta-data/denovo_map.log)**

I tried looking for the error, and saw that it could be due to my computer's memory, but I also ran it on a cluster, and got the same error, I also saw that it could probably be due to the ID of the samples, but I tried to change them and they still do not finish the process, and I'm still confused because I don't know if I'm using some command or parameter wrong",JavierUrban,https://github.com/JavierUrban/Genome-assembly-of-the-copepod-Leptodiaptomus/issues/4,JavierUrban++Genome-assembly-of-the-copepod-Leptodiaptomus.csv

- [x] README: It would be clearer if you could briefly state in which order one needs to run **all** of your scripts. Notice that all scripts in `/bin` should be mentioned in the README, this is currently not the case.
- [x] README: not all of the programs you used are mentioned in ""Software versions used"", for instance bwa is missing.
- [x] README: specify if your Illumina data is single end or pair end and whether it was already demultiplexed
- [x] README: briefly explain the contents of all of the files in `/meta-data`. In the case of files with columns, please briefly mention what does each column mean.
- [x] Script `DeNovo_assembly.sh` line 43 and script `pilon.sh` line 6: `mkadir` is not a command, correct it for `mkdir`. Since the directories where not being created, also check that this was not causing an error.
- [x] Scripts: When you use `mkdir` in an script, is good practice to add the flag `-p` so that the script can be run several times without causing an error because the directory already exists. Please use `mkdir -p` in all your scripts that currently use `mkdir`
- [x] Don't forget to add a short summary explaining your main results, this can be part of the README or a separate md file.
- [x] Don't forget to add a R figure and the code used to make it. This can be done a simple plot of your number of reads or any data you already have.
- [x] When making commits, don't forget to add **relevant** short messages indicating what did you change.

I noticed that you use Dfam as your repeat library. Could you consider to add  DNApipeTE and REPET which are tools for de novo annotation and soft masking of transposable elements (TEs) in genome assemblies, similar to The Extensive de novo TE Annotator (EDTA) and RepeatMasker.

DNApipeTE is a pipeline that includes several steps for TE annotation and soft masking, including repeat identification, classification, and masking. DNApipeTE utilizes several other tools, including RepeatModeler, RepeatMasker, and RepeatExplorer, to perform these tasks. The output of DNApipeTE includes a consensus library of repeat sequences, as well as annotations of putative TE locations in the genome, and a soft-masked genome assembly.

REPET is another pipeline that includes several steps for TE annotation and soft masking, including repeat identification, classification, clustering, and masking. REPET utilizes several other tools, including RepeatModeler, RepeatMasker, and PILER, to perform these tasks. The output of REPET includes a consensus library of repeat sequences, as well as annotations of putative TE locations in the genome, and a soft-masked genome assembly.

EDTA is a tool that is specifically designed for de novo annotation of transposable elements (TEs) in genome assemblies. The output of EDTA includes a consensus library of repeat sequences, as well as annotations of putative TE locations in the genome.

Both DNApipeTE and REPET provide similar functionalities to EDTA and RepeatMasker, and the output of these pipelines can be used for downstream analyses. However, the specific algorithms and parameters used by these pipelines may differ, resulting in different outputs and soft masking results. The choice of which tool to use will depend on the specific needs of the analysis and the characteristics of the genome assembly being analyzed.

Thank you for considering.

Hi,
I recently came across Mikado which is a pipeline to identify the most useful or “best” set of transcripts from multiple transcript assemblies. Our approach leverages transcript assemblies generated by multiple methods to define expressed loci, assign a representative transcript and return a set of gene models that selects against transcripts that are chimeric, fragmented or with short or disrupted CDS. Loci are first defined based on overlap criteria and each transcript therein is scored based on up to 50 available metrics relating to ORF and cDNA size, relative position of the ORF within the transcript, UTR length and presence of multiple ORFs. Mikado can also utilize blast data to score transcripts based on proteins similarity and to identify and split chimeric transcripts. Optionally, junction confidence data as provided by [Portcullis](https://github.com/maplesond/portcullis) can be used to improve the assessment. The best-scoring transcripts are selected as the primary transcripts of their respective gene loci; additionally, Mikado can bring back other valid splice variants that are compatible with the primary isoform.

![giy093fig1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/588297/231946974-c409f5db-f1a1-4b7a-aa49-d982571c5b38.jpeg)

Mikado uses GTF or GFF files as mandatory input. Non-mandatory but highly recommended input data can be generated by obtaining a set of reliable splicing junctions with Portcullis_, by locating coding ORFs on the transcripts using either [Transdecoder](https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder/) or [Prodigal](https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal), and by obtaining homology information through either [BLASTX](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download) or [DIAMOND](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/).

Could the output from Mikado be used to train Augustus, GlimmerHMM and SNAP?

Than you for considering.

Best wishes,

Currently, RepeatMasker runs on chunks of the assembly, containing full scaffolds/chromosomes. For highly contiguous assemblies, this can mean excessively long run times.

I am running the most current version of @marchoeppner dev branch on Tower on a real dataset. The workflow passed repeat masking and produced the `consensi.fa` file but failed very quickly at the subsequent staging process with: 
```
cp: can't stat '/.nextflow/assets/marchoeppner/genomeannotator/assets/repeatmasker/my_genome.fa': No such file or directory
```
Since I ran this on Tower it's a little difficult to debug things in the `.nextflow/assets` directory so this isn't obvious to me yet where this `my_genome.fa` file was supposed to come from.

I conducted a run using the following command and nextflow.config.
conda activate nf-core
nextflow run nf-core/genomeannotator -r dev -profile conda

Command error:
.command.sh: 行 2: gaas_fasta_filter_by_size.pl: not found such a command

How can I install required executables including the gaas_fasta_filter_by_size.pl script?

P.S. I tried to run with 'nextflow run nf-core/genomeannotator -r dev -profile singularity' before using -profile conda.
But I encountered the same error as ""#18 Pipeline fail at REPEATMASKER_STAGELIB"".
In this case, several parameter settings, including singularity.runOptions/singularity.envWhitelist in nextflow.config and SINGULARITY_BIND, had no effect.

There are two reason for that:

If done on CPU those overlaps should ideally be post-processed during next matcher + overlapper iteration, giving around 0.5us to process each overlap. Even if we use multiple threads this will still not give us more than 3 - 5us per overlap.

Our default parameters, however, differ from those of minimap2. In addition, they seem to be unstable on many GPUs, causing crashes.

This is a major barrier to entry for users - they want the program to run to completion, even at the expense of performance.

Minimap2 defaults:
- [x] Minimizer kmer size: 15
- [x]  Minimizer window size: 10
- [x] Minimum number of minimizers in a chain: 3
- [x] Max distance between minimizers before chain is terminated: 5000
- [x] Minimum overlap size: <500
- [x] Minibatch size: 500M

Most of these can be addressed by either a single cudamapper parameter or a combination of multiple parameters. 

In the case of minibatch size, it's not so much about matching the number as it is about providing a stable CLI. I find I'm often having to tweak the `-I, -i, -q, -Q, -c, -C, -m` parameters to balance memory usage (e.g. to prevent out-of-memory errors) and performance. I think we should establish safe defaults for long reads on 8GB, 16GB and 32GB memory GPUs. Even though we programatically check for max preallocated memory we often seem to OOM due to index size parameterizations. My vote would be to prioritize stability and provide a one-pager on tuning for max performance (acknowledging the limits of each GPU considering maximum read size).

As a consequence of this if the last block in memory has e.g. 300 free bytes and 300B are requested those 300 requested bytes will be rounded up to 512B and the allocation will fail due to insufficient memory (for details see PR #598).
The property of aligning allocations to 256B should be kept, but their sizes should not be rounded up.

1.
```
You could avoid the construction of the std::string by directly operating on the stream:

std::ostream& operator << (std::ostream& os, LogLevel level)
{
    switch(level)
    {
       case critical: os << ""CRITICAL""; break;
       ...
    }
    return os;
}
or, if you dislike overloading operators, a similar function void add_prefix(std::ostream& os, LogLevel level).
```
 
2.
```
We could actually base the whole logger on overloading << instead of macros and std::strings, providing a syntax like:

 log(LogLevel::debug) << ""here's some debug integer: "" << some_integer << std::endl;
Advantages:

common C++ syntax.
messages become almost no-ops if a higher logging level is selected.
Disadvantage:

more templates -> Slightly higher compilation times.

I_kwDOC02oTc475z5D,[cudamapper] compared to minimap2,OPEN,2021-09-23T04:44:12Z,2021-09-23T04:44:12Z,,"Hi,

I've tried doing alignment by cudamapper over 3 datasets, and compared to that by minimap2. 
The time costs don't reduce much when compared to minimap2. In some cases, the running speeds of cudamapper are slower than minimap2, as shown in the below table.

  | Name | wall time(s) | mem peak(G) | note
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
data 1 | cudamapper | 650.63 | 10.87 | v100, 16G
  | minimap2_v2.20 | 1687.86 | 31.53 | -t 32 -k 17 -w 17 -x ava-ont
data 2 | cudamapper | 11193 | 39.76 | v100, 16G
  | minimap2_v2.20 | 4491 | 19.21 | -t 32 -k 17 -w 17 -x ava-ont
data 3 | cudamapper | 5958 | 27.4 | NVIDIA TITAN xp, 12G
  | minimap2_v2.20 | 4590 | 54.02 | -t 32 -x ava-ont

Also, the sensitivity of the cudamapper alignments is lower than that of minimap2, which leads to the poorer assembly results based on cudamapper alignments of the 3 above datasets. The algorithm of cudamapper might need to be modified to get alignment results similar to minimap2.

The next step, involving applying the VCF variants to the reference in order to get the corrected genomic sequence, is done by external tools such as `bcftools consensus`. After that, a new annotation file (i.e. gff and/or tbl) have to be generated by running external genome annotation tools. However, as far as i'm concern, we don't have to reannotate the corrected genome sequence.

A way to overcome this is by fixing the original genome annotation in those annotation features where frameshifts were located. Furthermore, literature shows that some indels leading to stop-codons within an ORF may be caused by true variants, particularly in fewer prokaryotes species [1]. This bacterial evolutionary event is known as ORF pseudogenisation. My proposals are (1) correct original annotations by lifting over annotation features positions from reference (initial genome sequence) to new genome sequence (i.e. after applying VCF variants), (2) if corrected gene annotation still leads to truncated protein annotate it with pseudogene tag and (3) output GFF3 following NCBI genbank genome submission guidelines [2].

Hifiasm has built-in purging of haplotigs and seem to claim that purge_dups is too aggressive in purging (https://github.com/chhylp123/hifiasm/issues/162).  Have you done comparisons of the purging done by hifiasm and purge_dups? Would it make sense to allow users to disable the purge_dups purging or allow users to set the hifiasm purging parameters?

Hi there!

I'm currently using the pipeline to assembly some data, and I find myself having issues with the polishing step. According to the error message, the longranger singularity image seems to be broken or no longer exists. I include here the .log file of the run. 

On the other hand, I had to run the pipeline without the organelles workflow as I have not figured out how to get it running, so I take advantage of the Longranger bug to make a few questions. Is the API key of the singularity secret provided by the HPC admin or is it something that I can find on my HPC home directory? Do i need to run the workflow with internet connection? This last question is because everything has to be run on an offline node, but pulling everything with nf-core tools was doing the work so far. I also include the .log of the organelles workflow.

Thanks in advance for all the help with the bug and the questions. Looking forward to your response.

Found whilst reviewing #44 

In the contact_maps subworkflow, bedtools/bamtobed already sorts the bed file, cf https://github.com/sanger-tol/nf-core-modules/blob/main/modules/bedtools/bamtobed/main.nf#L28
There is no need to sort it again at https://github.com/sanger-tol/genomenote/blob/dev/subworkflows/local/contact_maps.nf#L41

(noticed that because bedtools/bamtobed takes a ton of memory)

2), `GCA_946965045.1.csv` contains:
```csv

3), and many more intermediate files are also named `GCA_946965045.1.*`, indicating that the pipeline is confused about what is `meta.id`.

The input file names can be different from the accession number etc, but I'd expect the outputs of the pipeline to be consistently named.

The `genome_note_template.docx` provided in the pipeline has inconsistent naming of some variables. For instance, the scaffold N50 is indicated with both `SCAFF_N50` (in the text) and `scaffold_N50` (in the table). The pipeline uses `SCAFF_N50` as the variable, leaving the field in the table empty.
The contig N50 is indicated as `contig_N50` in the table but the pipeline provides `CONTIG_N50` so the table is still empty.
The title of the table 2 refers to a variable named `species` but `SPECIES_GENUS` is defined by the pipeline so it remains empty.
There are probably more examples like this.

Currently, the pipeline orders the sequences in the contact map by decreasing size (`FILTER_GENOME` process). Whilst it is reasonable for many species, there are cases where it's not the best choice:

- Some species have chromosome names that predate genome sequencing and don't follow the sizes in base-pairs. This is the case of many primates, starting with human, chimpanzee, gibbon, etc.
- Traditionally, sex chromosomes are placed after the autosomes.
- Very large genomes like [Meconema thalassinum](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_946902985.2/) have sequences too large to be in INSDC as one piece (the limit is 2^31-1 bp) and are split into chromosome 1_1, chromsome 1_2, etc. On the map, the fragments have to be put right next to each other in the right order.

To overcome this, I propose reading the sequence report from NCBI datasets, which is already pulled by the pipeline and is ordered correctly, and copy the order into the contact map.",muffato,https://github.com/sanger-tol/genomenote/issues/88,sanger-tol++genomenote.csv

We've been regularly hit issues in production: no more space in `/var/tmp` and then farm nodes closed.

The problems come from the `sort` commands leaving files in their `/tmp`.

First, the biocontainer isn't mounting `/tmp` properly and instead uses `/var/tmp`, which only has 40 GB. Our workaround is to explicitly mount `/tmp`.

The second issue comes from LSF killing the `sort` commands because of MEMLIMIT.

A question following the BGA genomenote session:

Stephania Sandoval: I had to leave the session a bit early today but I wanted to ask if the pipeline can be used for more than one species at a time. For example, if you have several species from the same genus and want to put them all in one genome note instead of individual notes, can that be incorporated into this pipeline? thank you!

I_kwDODBV7Ws5Bex0v,Synteny diversity calculation?,OPEN,2022-01-11T02:40:28Z,2022-01-11T06:48:34Z,,"Hi Wen-Biao,

Thanks for providing the code for your recent publication. Good work on this.

I just have a query about the calculation of synteny diversity.

In the publication, it is defined as:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13409610/148715410-1079d1ed-ccf7-4c69-85e6-a38ab9b64603.png)

It looks like the script 'calculate.syn.diversity.pl' takes all pairwise comparisons and sums the number of times a site is non-synonymous then divides this sum by the total number of comparisons. Is this correct?

If i and j from the equation refer to all pairwise comparisons and pi_ij is either a 1 or a 0, or  the fraction of 1s over all possible pairwise comparisons, this is not quite the same as what the script actually does. 

For example, working with 11 genomes, we would have 55 pairwise comparisons. Let's say 20/55 comparisons evaluate to 1 as the sites are syntenic. The fraction of syntenic comparisons would be 20/55. This seems to be the number that 'calculate.syn.diversity.pl' gives us. However, this is not what one would get using the algebra in the equation.

For example:
`Pi=0`
`for(i in 1:10){for(j in (i+1):11){Pi=Pi+1/11*(1/11)*(20/55)}}`

Would set Pi to about 0.17, whereas 20/55 is actually 0.36. If you keep 20/55 as the fraction of non-syntenic sites among all pairwise comparisons then perform the same analysis for all isolates including self-comparisons, for example:

`Pi=0`
`for(i in 1:11){for(j in 1:11){Pi=Pi+1/11*(1/11)*(20/55)}}`

Then Pi will be set to 0.36, which is the same as just outputting 20/55. Is this what the equation is describing? If so, one could omit the summation of x_ij and just say that this statistic is the fraction of non-syntenic sites among all pairwise comparisons. It would be a lot simpler.

Please can you provide a few more details on synteny diversity and how calculate.syn.diversity.pl works? Is my interpretation of this script correct?

Dear SGN,

I am parsing the data from 360 genomes project. I've seen so far that some SNPs in the VCF files of SL2.50 have a wrong reference allele. For example, having the following list:

SL2.50ch01      39138511        G       C
SL2.50ch01      39141120        T       A
SL2.50ch01      39144494        G       C
SL2.50ch01      39162103        G       C
SL2.50ch01      39175764        G       C
SL2.50ch01      39177173        G       C
SL2.50ch01      39186267        G       C
SL2.50ch01      39192822        G       C

SL2.50ch01      39207130        G       C

the first column is the chromosome name, the second column contains the position in the reference genome SL2.50, the third column is the reference allele in your VCF files, and the 4th column is actually the reference allele in SL2.50.

It does not happen in all SNPs, only in some of them. Why do I see so many transversions? Why did you choose different strands at the time of reporting your variants?

We've seen from #29 and #26 that java returns a different value than `getip.sh`.  `getip.sh` is just a hack that reads out the IP address from `ifconfig` for `eth0`.

In other words, it's a hack.  Users may not have their setup on `eth0`-- I imagine that's the error you saw, @JavierJia ? your laptop is probably connecting over wifi and therefore doesn't use eth0? We're seeing this on travis, where some machines [aren't connected on eth0](https://travis-ci.org/uci-cbcl/genomix/jobs/12915715) and others are...

I think the solution is probably a very small java program that uses the java API rather than parsing from eth0.

Elmira found a pretty major problem when running without `-saveIntermediateResults` recently:  the vertex value is unchanged between iterations.  I had thought that the entire dataset would be scrubbed by going through the Input/OutputFormat adapters between jobs (Node -> P4VertexValue -> Node -> RayVertexValue -> Node -> ...).  

Turns out that's false and the only reason we haven't noticed before is because of a bug in pregelix by which concatenated jobs all use the generic base class `VertexValue`.  I've submitted the bug report to @sigmod and there's a temporary solution: we manually scrub the data on the first iteration.

In the meantime, I recommend using `-saveIntermediateResults` to make sure that the state gets wiped between jobs. Specifying this flag will force an HDFS write and therefore a trip through the Input/OutputFormat adapters.

I was thinking about scaffolding last night.  I mentioned in #101 some ideas and future optimizations but thought I'd do a brain dump here as well.

Here's an idea for a ""SplitRepeat"" job:  take the current framework but for each walk node that has 2+ back- or incoming-edges, we can request the candidate's score according to the read sequences in those back edges.  When two candidates seem to have nearly equal scores, we can turn turn to the backedge scores to try to split the repeated frontier node (or some portion of the walk).

In ascii art:

```
         b1
           \  ----c1
w1--w2--w3--f<
              ----c2
```

in the simple version of this algorithm, we request scores of the subkmers `f--c1` and `f--c2` from b1 which aggregates the score to `f`, just like the walk nodes `w1`-`w3` do.  If we get a ""strong"" signal from b1 about one of the paths (say, `b1--f--c1`) and it's not the same as the path that's strong in the walk (say, `w1--w2--w3--f--c2`), then we could assume that `f` is a repeat node, shared by the two different paths.  We could the split `f` into `f1` and `f2`, resulting in the paths `b1--f1--c1` and `w1--w2--w3--f--c2`.

We tried to run some pipeline steps using data that was dumped on Thursday as input... there are many missing directories (though some are still intact).

With your #108, we gain the option to store the node in the local fs.  I think what we now need is a way to store the full set in the write() and read() calls.  Pregelix uses an adapter to dump from the vertex to an HDFS-based `Node`. I think in our output format,
we can explicitly set the readheadset to be dumped inside the node.  You should be able to add it somewhere aroung https://github.com/uci-cbcl/genomix/blob/genomix/fullstack_genomix/genomix/genomix-pregelix/src/main/java/edu/uci/ics/genomix/pregelix/base/GenericVertexToNodeOutputFormat.java#L34

I used  `bowtie2     -x rRNA_mm10_reference_genome/bowtie2_index/rRNA     -U ../clean_Sample_1_R1.fastq.gz   -S rRNA_trash.sam   --un mrna_sample1.fastq` And I assume unmapped as normal mrna. 
 For the next step, I put the unmapped reads to STARaligner, and got the mapped mrna reads. 
```
STAR --genomeDir reference_genome/mm10_Gencode_STAR \
	--runThreadN 40 \
	--readFilesIn mrna_sample1.fastq \
	--outFileNamePrefix sample1_mRNA_R1 \
	--outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate
```
Later, I used feature count to get the count matrix `featureCounts -a gencode.vM10.annotation.gtf -g gene_name -o count_sample1_R1_ds sample1_mRNA_R1Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam` And I found there are huge numbers of Rn18s-rs5 gene, which is a typical 18s rRNA. But it show up in the mrna files (All rRNA should be filter out) that should not contain any rRNA. I double check those reads  in the genome browser(IGV) and majority of them does not have splice sites. Could you help me check this issue? Thanks a lot.

MDU6SXNzdWUxODg4OTk1MjY=,Dealing with optional variables (basic types and enum),OPEN,2016-11-12T08:05:13Z,2016-11-14T15:50:31Z,,"I am learning how to use Genome, and so far I am impressed with the flexibility offered by Genome. 👍  

1.  Is it possible to declare optional variables (both basic type and enum) that will not be mapped to JSON at all if they are nil? 
2. An extension to this question is how do I specify the transformToNode and transformFromNode functions for these optional variables?
3. I am trying to extend Date class, making it NodeRepresentable and NodeConvertible. (See code below). Would this implementation be able to handle when _date_ is nil during serialization (my intention is to skip saving _date_ data if _date_ is nil) and when the JSON data is absent during deserialization (my intention is to leave the _date_ variable uninitialized)?

```swift
extension Date: NodeRepresentable {
    public func makeNode(context: Context = EmptyNode) throws -> Node {
        return .string(self.ISO8601String())
    }
}

extension Date: NodeConvertible {
    public init(node: Node, in context: Context) throws {
        guard let string = node.string else {
            throw NodeError.unableToConvert(node: node, expected: ""\(String.self)"")
        }
        guard let date = Date.dateFromISO8601String(string: string) else {
            throw NodeError.unableToConvert(node: node, expected: ""Date is stored in ISO8601 format"")
        }
        self = date
    }
}
```

Example class definition:
```swift
enum FooType: Int8 {
    case typeA
    case typeB
}

class Bar: BasicMappable {
    var foo: FooType?
    var date: Date?
    var name: String?
    
    required init() {
    }
    
    func sequence(map: Map) throws {
        try foo <~> map[""foo""]
        try date <~> map[""date""]
        try name <~> map[""name""]
    }
}
```

- [ ] Identify common entities across all the datasets we've collected so far i.e. a company name

- [ ] Justify why we need joins - is this to help with analysis? Which analysis? Is this to expand data collection?
- [ ] Develop an evaluation strategy for joining i.e. develop a ground truth dataset of the same entity across different datasets - report on how many entities do we in/correctly join etc.? How do these metrics change subject to different entity matching algorithms and preprocessing methods?

There are two reason for that:
a) One matcher + overlapper iteration on our benchmark currently takes around 115ms (that number will likely be cut at least in half in the future) and generate 220k overlaps. If done on CPU those overlaps should ideally be post-processed during next matcher + overlapper iteration, giving around 0.5us to process each overlap. Even if we use multiple threads this will still not give us more than 3 - 5us per overlap.
b) Output generation is likely to move to GPU and for that we would need the overlaps to remain on device.

Our default parameters, however, differ from those of minimap2. In addition, they seem to be unstable on many GPUs, causing crashes.

This is a major barrier to entry for users - they want the program to run to completion, even at the expense of performance.

Minimap2 defaults:
- [x] Minimizer kmer size: 15
- [x]  Minimizer window size: 10
- [x] Minimum number of minimizers in a chain: 3
- [x] Max distance between minimizers before chain is terminated: 5000
- [x] Minimum overlap size: <500
- [x] Minibatch size: 500M

Most of these can be addressed by either a single cudamapper parameter or a combination of multiple parameters. 

In the case of minibatch size, it's not so much about matching the number as it is about providing a stable CLI. I find I'm often having to tweak the `-I, -i, -q, -Q, -c, -C, -m` parameters to balance memory usage (e.g. to prevent out-of-memory errors) and performance. I think we should establish safe defaults for long reads on 8GB, 16GB and 32GB memory GPUs. Even though we programatically check for max preallocated memory we often seem to OOM due to index size parameterizations. My vote would be to prioritize stability and provide a one-pager on tuning for max performance (acknowledging the limits of each GPU considering maximum read size).

The right way to fix this is to properly handle repetitive minimizers. We could do this with a fixed mask, a weighting function like that used in WinnowMap, or by rearchitecting the sketch handling in cudamapper to function like MashMap.

As a consequence of this if the last block in memory has e.g. 300 free bytes and 300B are requested those 300 requested bytes will be rounded up to 512B and the allocation will fail due to insufficient memory (for details see PR #598).
The property of aligning allocations to 256B should be kept, but their sizes should not be rounded up.

1.
```
You could avoid the construction of the std::string by directly operating on the stream:

std::ostream& operator << (std::ostream& os, LogLevel level)
{
    switch(level)
    {
       case critical: os << ""CRITICAL""; break;
       ...
    }
    return os;
}
or, if you dislike overloading operators, a similar function void add_prefix(std::ostream& os, LogLevel level).
```
 
2.
```
We could actually base the whole logger on overloading << instead of macros and std::strings, providing a syntax like:

 log(LogLevel::debug) << ""here's some debug integer: "" << some_integer << std::endl;
Advantages:

common C++ syntax.
messages become almost no-ops if a higher logging level is selected.
Disadvantage:

more templates -> Slightly higher compilation times.

I've tried doing alignment by cudamapper over 3 datasets, and compared to that by minimap2. 
The time costs don't reduce much when compared to minimap2. In some cases, the running speeds of cudamapper are slower than minimap2, as shown in the below table.

  | Name | wall time(s) | mem peak(G) | note
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
data 1 | cudamapper | 650.63 | 10.87 | v100, 16G
  | minimap2_v2.20 | 1687.86 | 31.53 | -t 32 -k 17 -w 17 -x ava-ont
data 2 | cudamapper | 11193 | 39.76 | v100, 16G
  | minimap2_v2.20 | 4491 | 19.21 | -t 32 -k 17 -w 17 -x ava-ont
data 3 | cudamapper | 5958 | 27.4 | NVIDIA TITAN xp, 12G

Also, the sensitivity of the cudamapper alignments is lower than that of minimap2, which leads to the poorer assembly results based on cudamapper alignments of the 3 above datasets. The algorithm of cudamapper might need to be modified to get alignment results similar to minimap2.

I_kwDOC02oTc5EohQj,[cudapoa] Kernel error,OPEN,2022-02-26T08:32:32Z,2022-02-26T08:32:32Z,,"Hello,
I tried updating GenomeWorks inside Racon from v0.5.3 to v2021.02.2 (and even v2021.02.0), and get kernel errors while using `BandMode::full_band` (only cudapoa is enabled, without bands):

`_deps/genomeworks-src/cudapoa/src/cudapoa_batch.cuh:451] Kernel Error: Traceback in Needleman-Wunsch algorithm failed. in batch 8
Suggestion  : You may retry with a different banding mode.`

Got any suggestions what could be causing this? I have two tests with the same data, one [with](https://github.com/lbcb-sci/racon/blob/master/test/racon_test.cpp#L454-L470) QV the other [without](https://github.com/lbcb-sci/racon/blob/master/test/racon_test.cpp#L472-L488), and the first one finishes successfully while the other yields the error above and the process hangs.

Thanks for providing those wonderful reference genome. It helps me a lot in my research. I met a problem that many of my reads could mapped to rrna region but was classified to not aligned when using bowtie2 alignment. Here is the details:
I used  `bowtie2     -x rRNA_mm10_reference_genome/bowtie2_index/rRNA     -U ../clean_Sample_1_R1.fastq.gz   -S rRNA_trash.sam   --un mrna_sample1.fastq` And I assume unmapped as normal mrna. 
 For the next step, I put the unmapped reads to STARaligner, and got the mapped mrna reads. 
```
STAR --genomeDir reference_genome/mm10_Gencode_STAR \
	--runThreadN 40 \
	--readFilesIn mrna_sample1.fastq \
	--outFileNamePrefix sample1_mRNA_R1 \
	--outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate
```
Later, I used feature count to get the count matrix `featureCounts -a gencode.vM10.annotation.gtf -g gene_name -o count_sample1_R1_ds sample1_mRNA_R1Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam` And I found there are huge numbers of Rn18s-rs5 gene, which is a typical 18s rRNA. But it show up in the mrna files (All rRNA should be filter out) that should not contain any rRNA. I double check those reads  in the genome browser(IGV) and majority of them does not have splice sites. Could you help me check this issue? Thanks a lot.

Note that the exact effective genome size might be bigger than the values we indicate in the help texts if you have very long sequencing reads. For the example above, RPGC would work as follows:
sequencing depth = (total number of mapped reads * fragment length) / effective genome size = 50 x 10^6 * 200/ 2.15057 x 10^9 = 4.65

I run RepeatMasker on different libraries ( one is build by RepeatModeler, another is 'species' contained in the RepBase ) according to your command, but I add the parameter `-xsmall [returns repetitive regions in lowercase (rest capitals) rather than masked]` because I notice it is recommended that the braker runs on genomic sequences that have been softmasked for Repeats. And also the option `--softmasking` is suitable for softmasked genomes. The command looks like this:
```
RepeatMasker -pa 20 -lib 01_repeatModeler-denovo-repeat.lib/RM_*/consensi.fa.classified -html -gff -xsmall -dir 02_delete-denovo-lib-result genome.fa &>RepeatMasker_run.log1
RepeatMasker -pa 20 -species ""Lepidoptera"" -html -gff -xsmall -dir 03_delete-repeatmasker-lib-result 02_delete-denovo-lib-result/genome.fa.masked &>RepeatMasker_run.log2
RepeatMasker -pa 20 -species ""Lepidoptera"" -html -gff -xsmall -noint -dir 04_delete-repeamasker-noint-result 03_delete-repeatmasker-lib-result/genome.fa.masked.masked &>RepeatMasker_run.log3
```
I have compared the two masked genome generated by run 1 & 2, I see some sequences that is masked in the first run (with `-lib`) is unmasked in the second run (with `-species`). I think this case is caused by the option `-xsmall`, so I run again above commands but delete the option `-xsmall` and this problem is solved.

It is confusing that this pipeline use the genome.fa.masked.masked in `03_delete-repeatmasker-lib-result/genome.fa.masked.masked` directory rather than the genome.fa.masked.masked.masked in `04_delete-repeamasker-noint-result/genome.fa.masked.masked.masked` directory to run BRAKER. 

So what the meaning of run 3 ( with `-noint` ) ? If we run RepeatMasker in hardmasking model, I think the `braker.pl` shouldn't add the option `--softmasking`. If we run RepeatMasker in softmasking model, does the better way is to combine the libraries into one library as mentioned by jebrosen https://github.com/Dfam-consortium/TETools/issues/20#issuecomment-983927917 and then feed the genome.fa.masked ( soft-masking ) to BRAKER with `--softmasking` ?",yshcai,https://github.com/meiyang12/Genome-annotation-pipeline/issues/3,meiyang12++Genome-annotation-pipeline.csv

    - [ ] We specified a fixed-size window for computing overlaps.  How could we have looked at 
       various settings of this distance parameter?  A: repeat the anchor_center code section for
       various widths using the map + bind_ranges strategy.

      the DE genes (FDR 1%, testing against a null region of |LFC| < 1), and to the FDR cutoff (1%)
      for the DA peaks? A: here you could create a grouping variable using the same strategy as the  example using `summarise_at`
   - [x] Due to the one-to-many mappings of DE genes to peaks, we don't know if we have the same number of DE genes participating or less, as we increase the threshold on the peak LFC. A: group by gene_id before counting. It also occurs to me that we could be using `reduce_ranges()` instead of summarise to avoid grouping by everything.

>  I think you've shown how to compute lots of things that people want to compute, but maybe we can do better at naming variables. An example: ""any_peaks"" is made from ""overlap_genes"" and consists of genes. I know we don't want names to be too long, but maybe we can come up with a variable naming convention for the enrichment section. To create ""enrichments"" involves a lot of steps and intermediate objects. Again, the final plot is exactly what we want, but maybe if we had a convention for naming the intermediates it may help.

I agree, maybe something like when doing summarise or reduce_ranges:

If it’s still a granges object use suffix gr, otherwise use df. 

If it’s been grouped and then summarized we name it as  group_name + last result. So any_peaks would be gene_peak_lfc_gr, and overlap tab would be origin_peak_lfc_df and so on. Now that I think of the variable any should really be changed to peak_count. Does that clear things up?

I just wanted to bring up an issue that I have run into when using the wf-bacterial-genomes workflow. I am getting this error on the medakaNetwork process when I run the workflow on a directory of fastqs from one barcode. However, if I pre concatenate the barcode fastqs I do not run into this issue. For the time being is pre concatenating a suitable fix, would it harm the final output of the analysis?

Thank you.

Hi, 

Report appears to be showing 3rd top hit of blast results from metaquast against SILVA 16s database. 

Example metaquast blast result:

```
# BLASTN 2.13.0+

Appears to be the run_species_stats function in report.py where species_data df has top hit as header, and top_hit takes 2nd row (i.e 3rd row of quast blast output). 
```
def run_species_stats(species_stats_path, sample_names):    
    """"""Analysis of metaquast data.""""""
    results = []
    for indexs, sample_name in enumerate(sample_names):
        species_data_path = os.path.join(
            species_stats_path, ""blast.res_""+sample_name+""-medaka"")
        species_data = pd.read_csv(species_data_path, sep='\t', comment=""#"")
        top_hit = species_data.iloc[1, :]
        species_split = re.split(""\\."", top_hit[1])[2].split("";"")
        species = species_split[len(species_split)-1]
        species = re.sub(""_"", "" "", species)
        results.append(
            {'Sample': sample_name,
             'Species': species,
             'Perc_identity': top_hit[2]})
    results_df = pd.DataFrame(results, index=sample_names).iloc[:, 1:3]
    results_df.columns = ['Species ID', 'Identity (%)']
    return results_df
```

Possible fix:
```
def run_species_stats(species_stats_path, sample_names):    
    """"""Analysis of metaquast data.""""""
    results = []
    for indexs, sample_name in enumerate(sample_names):

Hi,

I have been trying to get this workflow to run for awhile with no success. When attempting to run the workflow on demo data it rapidly fails and produces a ""stops with error"" outcome. 

The log shows that there is an error when calling prokka:
Command error:
touch: cannot touch '.command.trace': Permission denied

I have tried altering permissions to the directory to be the most permissive with no success. 

Would you be able to help?

Thanks,
Charlie

First off thank you for this great program <3

The program unfortunately does not run. I have attached the screenshot of my termainal to show the error message that I am getting. It says this:
No such variable: Exception evaluating property 'out' for nextflow.script.ChannelOut, Reason: groovy.lang.MissingPropertyException: No such property: out for class: groovyx.gpars.dataflow.DataflowBroadcast


Thank you for the help!

I_kwDOFIO7Dc5lDQFW,[Bug]: Problem with Metaquast-part of report,CLOSED,2023-05-04T06:40:05Z,2023-08-18T11:15:48Z,2023-08-18T11:15:47Z,"### What happened?

Hi Team,

When running the workflow, it stops (either when using reference-based assembly or de novo assembly) with an error because the report cannot be compiled. This might be due to missing reference files for metaquast (see log output). I am using a proxy server for internet connection.
Is there any workaround for this? I did not find the folder mentioned in the error message to manually provide the reference file.

Thank you very much in advance!

Hi, 
I am getting a consisent error when including --isolate true in my pipeline
It appears the pipeline isn't writing the results of PointFinder to the work directory, as the pipeline is unable to find it to run 'calling_pipeline:run_isolates:processResfinder'

When navigating to the work directory, I can see that the file ""PointFinder_results.txt"" file does not exists, but the ResFinder results are there

I use the bacterial genome workflow with data from Plasmidsaurus, a commercial plasmid/genome sequencing service based on Nanopore sequencing tech. They use the r1041_e82_400bps_sup_v4.2.0 basecalling option, which seems to be absent from the current Medeka models. 

### Describe the solution you'd like

Train the Medeka model on r1041_e82_400bps_sup_v4.2.0 and include it as an option. 

### Describe alternatives you've considered

What would be the closest, currently available basecalling model?

At the moment, for using _Docker_, one needs to run the workflow with `-profile standard`. 
It might be more intuitive for users to use `-profile docker` to do this instead, which is the standard used by `nf-core` pipelines. 

### Describe the solution you'd like

I believe this could be done by changing the [current config file](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/wf-bacterial-genomes/blob/e223e1b85bd301fd73cac520048ac2d1fbd5f82a/nextflow.config#L102) to use something closer to what nf-core pipelines use ([example here](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/3bec2331cac2b5ff88a1dc71a21fab6529b57a0f/nextflow.config#L145)).

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Adding clearer documentation about the default behaviour to the README (and possibly the `--help` page) could be an alternative. At the moment this has to be inferred from the config source.

The sample appears to have high coverage. It is from bacteria with 4mb genome size.  Further investigation in the .nexflow.log file indicated it is a flye related error which seemed to be the case as reported [here](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye/issues/128).

 I manually configured the flye command in the 'main.nf' file by adding the `--asm-coverage` and `--genome-size` options which didn't throw that error anymore only threw a memory error.

Would it be convenient to add in the advanced options additional parameters in the pipeline for running flye like it is recommended [here](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye/issues/128#issuecomment-506509828) in a similar way you hva done for running prokka or medaka which are available in the pipeline usage help (`nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-bacterial-genomes --help`)?

Note:
The solution given in the flye issue above require to add additional paramter `--genome-size <value>` as shoen in the current flye usage [doc](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye/blob/flye/docs/USAGE.md#-quick-usage).

I recently [read from the Prokka author himself Torsten Seemann](https://twitter.com/torstenseemann/status/1565471892840259585) that [Bakta](https://github.com/oschwengers/bakta) would now be a better option to annotate bacterial genome as it is better maintained.


### Describe the solution you'd like

Would it be possible to add bakta to the pipeline and make this an option for those who want to stick to prokka?


### Describe alternatives you've considered

none for bacterial genomes but for bacterio-phages there is also [pharokka](https://github.com/gbouras13/pharokka) which makes an incredible good job.

The wf-bacterial-genomes workflow enables the reconstruction of circular genomes and plasmids. In the report, the number of circular contigs is indicated. However, it is difficult to determine which contigs are circular and which are linear. It seems that this information is not provided in the report, nor in the .gbk or fasta.gz files. It is necessary to delve into the 'work' directory and locate the flye_stats.tsv file to determine whether a contig is circular or not. 

### Describe the solution you'd like

Would it be possible to indicate in the report which contigs are circular? 

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Furthermore, could this information be included in the .gbk file? Currently, all circular contigs are identified as linear in the GBK file.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Sincerly

Not related to a problem

### Describe the solution you'd like

An option (or default) to output the gfa file and a Bandage plot of the gfa file for a quick visual summary of the assemblies (perhaps in the full summary report). Alternatively, just the Bandage plot.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

I've tried copying and renaming the assembly_graph.gfa output files from flye into the output dir, as it's possible to then make the Bandage plot. The .gfa files in the work directory aren't named by barcode so it's not possible to take them from there.

No problem, but if you are doing shotgun metagenomics for e.g. human stool samples, there are a lot of contigs!!

 The ability to collapse them or have the output on a separate page or chooseable like the Pavian sample level output would be very useful

Hello, 
I tried running the test dataset before using my own data and I get the following error: 
```

```

I tried other workflows (like wf-metagenomes) and they work, so it does not seem related to the Nextflow installation. I also tried removing the wf with `nextflow drop` and downloading it again but the issue persists. Even trying to get the help message by running `nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-bacterial-genomes --help` results on the same Script compilation error from above. Do you guys have any idea of what might be causing the issue? Thanks a lot for your time!
Best, 
Juan.

### What happened?

Hi!!!
We are running the workflow using the desktop version (however we are also having the same error using the command line). We have several samples (files) but some of them we cannot run using the workflow. It means that with some samples (files) the workflow ran perfectly but with other samples (files) appeared the following error:

### What happened?

I have been using wf-bacterial-genomes workflow for last 2 years. It worked fine till date. However, now it started showing following erros 

""ERROR ~ Script compilation error
- file : /home/hmn/.nextflow/assets/epi2me-labs/wf-bacterial-genomes/main.nf
- cause: Invalid output definition @ line 862, column 5.
       output(results.all_out)
       ^
I checked main.nf file fow syntax error but it is perfectly fine. Still I downloaded new file from source ""https://github.com/epi2me-labs/wf-bacterial-genomes/blob/master/main.nf""

Upgraded nextflow for latest version too.
Still not working for me. Need suggestions to troubleshoot.

Hi 
I want to ask that downstream from base calling we do error-correction using dorrado , the step which convert fastq to fasta. However in wf-bacterial workflow we directly use fastq. Which fastq is it - uncorrected. And can we use fasta as input.

Hi
When we basecall and demultiplex our pod5 reads, there are some unclassified bam piled up in one file. It still has reads but could not be demultiplexed. Is there a way to still utilize them- for example in a reference based assembly scenario, can we use them?

Uploaded fastq files (92 files), it runs for about 30 mins and then shows a ""stopped with error"". Tried it a few times. I then troubleshooted with the demo-data and the workflow works.
Opted to then run the files in batches of 10 and it works.

Hi, 

We are currently following the [NO-MISS protocol](https://nanoporetech.com/document/no-miss-isolate-sequencing-rapid-barcoding-v14) from nanopore. According to their protocol we leave the Minknown settings at default. In this case barcodes will not be trimmed from the FastQ files. Following their workflow they go straight from the raw data to the bacteria genomes pipeline. 

I am not sure if this pipeline trims the barcodes and if it is neccesary at all? Is there any information on this? ",kevinbretscher,https://github.com/epi2me-labs/wf-bacterial-genomes/issues/49,epi2me-labs++wf-bacterial-genomes.csv

Dear Georgie,

The most recent version of Parabricks includes Minimap2, and I need to run simple Minimap jobs, but I am having trouble using Parabricks on Gadi. Rather than a request for a feature, could you kindly provide some instructions or recommendations on how to achieve this?

I was trying to understand the logic behind your pipeline, but I can't find where you're calling or defining the ""singularity run..."" instruction. This would be my first time trying to run GPU-accelerated analysis. Is there something I’m not understanding about using Parabricks?

Thank you so much for your kind assistance.
