MDU6SXNzdWU0OTgxMjE3OTQ=,bug in APAAC,OPEN,2019-09-25T08:11:40Z,2019-09-25T08:13:22Z,,"Dear Superzchen,

The APAAC module fails when invoked from iLearn-protein-basic.py  with a fasta file with peptides of length 13. 
The problem I think is that the iLearn-protein-basic.py has a --format value 'tsv_1' that is missing in the APAAC module.

 Also, In the iLearn-auto-pipline looks like it is possible to invoke the APAAC module with the param lambdaValue, but the APAAC has  a --lamada parametr instead:

parser.add_argument(""--lamada"", type=int, default=30, help=""the lamada value for SOCNumber descriptor"")

cheers
