I've solved it! This issue happened probabilistically and it was the error coming from server, not from the script.
Hope this answer could help anyone else.

MDU6SXNzdWU1NjA5MzAzNw==,Paired End Date,CLOSED,2015-01-30T22:26:59Z,2016-09-13T21:05:10Z,2016-09-13T21:05:10Z,"Hi,
Thanks for providing such a great tool!
Just wondering did CIRCexplorer support paired end data? TopHat can align paired-end reads, but when I convert unmapped reads to PE fastq after sorted and indexed the bam file, there were very few reads converted successfully. But if I merged two paired end fastq (R and L) to give a single fastq file, CIRCexplorer worked good.
One more thing, can CIRCexplorer do secondary analysis of Chimeric.out.sam (output fusion detection data from RNA-STAR)? I tried to convert  Chimeric.out.sam to Chimeric.out.bam, and input the bam file to CIRCexplorer, but I got nothing. I compared the output files from TopHat-Fusion and rna-star, they are very similar to each other, and it is kind of strange that CIRCexplorer got nothing from Chimeric.out.bam.
Thanks again for the effor to make the tools avaiable to bioinformatics community.

I found CIRCexplore a very useful tool for detecting circRNA from RNA-seq. I am interested in detecting circRNA which completely falls in intron (=lariat sequence). I mapped the paired-end reads with tophat and executed this program in the same way as mentioned on github page, but I did not find circRNA associated with lariats, rather from exons. Can you suggest me if some how the tool can enforced to pic circ RNA only from introns.

Thanks.
