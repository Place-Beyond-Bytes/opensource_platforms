    When I get the clustalw.out.checked.filtered.structure file, how can I do statistics for it? For example, the number of gene with large structural variations.
    Thanks a lot!

We are very interested in your script about exploring genetic variation between genomes recently. However, we do not have any experience with such projects and lack of a good basis of biological information. Can you write an useage about ""Gene-SV""?

Thank you for the help.
