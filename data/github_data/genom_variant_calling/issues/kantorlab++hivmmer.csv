MDU6SXNzdWUzNzI1ODA2NzQ=,Validate hxb2 coordinates,CLOSED,2018-10-22T15:55:32Z,2020-02-28T00:56:59Z,2020-02-28T00:56:59Z,"In some edges cases, the output will no longer be in hxb2 coordinates. This can happen if:

1. The sample has zero coverage at a site.
2. The sample has 100% deletions at a site.

In both cases, the site will be dropped in the hmmsearch1 pHMM, and the resulting hmmsearch2 alignment is no longer in hxb2 coordinates. As a workaround, the hmmsearch1 results can be used, as these are in hxb2 coordinates based on the way the reference pHMM is constructed by `hivmmer-trim-reference`.

For a longer-term solution, the final results should be aligned back against hxb2 to validate the coordinates.",mhowison,https://github.com/kantorlab/hivmmer/issues/2

How hard would it be to implement support for subtype C? I'm happy to do this if you could all point me at what would have to happen to add support.

I made my own reference (thanks for the help with that) for gag but seems a region must be specified from pol, int, or env. It looks like maybe this is only used for noting what gene a codon is in--if that is the case, can I just use int as the region, or is there more going on here? Or can I change the code to add ""gag"" as an option for the reference?

Thank you!

I also read that you have some prepackaged profile Hidden Markov Models for the pol region in version 0.1.2, how can I use them?
