MDU6SXNzdWU0NTM3OTcxNzk=,Fail to create the external process in make_example step,OPEN,2019-06-08T14:01:02Z,2019-06-28T13:42:03Z,,"In the step of make_example, Bam2VcfPiperDeepVariantME.py does not create the external process of /usr/local/seqslab/deepvariant/bazel-bin/deepvariant/make_examples.
 
Per seqpiper.log, the log file shows that the input data of Bam2VcfPiperDeepVariantME.py, generated by PiedPiper.jar, could be invalid.
Because PiedPiper.jar is released in binary format, it's supposed that the others have no way to identify and fix this issue.

My system is based on hadoop-2.8.5 and spark-2.2.3.
There are 8 vcore and 100GB memory in one node.

Thanks.
