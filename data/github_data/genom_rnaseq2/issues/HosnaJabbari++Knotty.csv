Occurs with master branch and SHAPE branch with no shape data. Completes successfully with SHAPE data. I could post the structures some of the SHAPE ones predict if that would be useful but it's likely different.

On Compute Canada's Cedar, it took 30.5 hours and used 34 GB before failing.
The successful SHAPE run only took 30 hours and used 29 GB.
