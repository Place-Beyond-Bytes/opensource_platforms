I_kwDOBrwwHs5d9-GV,how to simulate knockdowns?,OPEN,2023-02-08T17:28:07Z,2023-02-08T17:28:07Z,,"Hi
Once we learn our network in seqnet and can generate gene expression are there functions to simulate knockdown experiments? I would like to see how the expression of the genes in the network change when we intervene one or more more genes.
thanks
